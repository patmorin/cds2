    abstract = { This paper contains a proof that every triangulation of an orientable surface of genus \$g > 1\$ with n vertices contains a noncontractible cycle of length \$O( \sqrt{n/g} \log g )\$. These bounds are tighter than those previously known, but are not the conjectured optimal. These results and techniques are related to “planarizing” problems in which a small set of vertices is sought whose removal leaves a planar graph and to “separator” problems in which a small set of vertices is sought whose removal leaves a graph with all components small. }

abstract = {Many divide-and-conquer algorithms on graphs are based on finding a small set of vertices or edges whose removal divides the graph roughly in half. Most graphs do not have the necessary small separators, but some useful classes do. One such class is planar graphs: If an n-vertex graph can be drawn on the plane, then it can be bisected by removal of O(sqrt(n)) vertices (R. J. Lipton and R. E. Tarjan, SIAM J. Appl. Math.36 (1979), 177–189). The main result of the paper is that if a graph can be drawn on a surface of genus g, then it can be bisected by removal of O(sqrt(gn)) vertices. This bound is best possible to within a constant factor. An algorithm is given for finding the separator that takes time linear in the number of edges in the graph, given an embedding of the graph in its genus surface. Some extensions and applications of these results are discussed.}

abstract = {We provide a data structure for maintaining an embedding of a graph on a surface (represented combinatorially by a permutation of edges around each vertex) and computing generators of the fundamental group of the surface, in amortized time O(log n + log g(log log g)3) per update on a surface of genus g; we can also test orientability of the surface in the same time, and maintain the minimum and maximum spanning tree of the graph in time O(log n + log4 g) per update. Our data structure allows edge insertion and deletion as well as the dual operations; these operations may implicitly change the genus of the embedding surface. We apply similar ideas to improve the constant factor in a separator theorem for low-genus graphs, and to find in linear time a tree-decomposition of low-genus low-diameter graphs.},
