\begin{abstract}
  We show that every $n$-vertex triangulation has a connected dominating set of size at most $10n/21$.  Equivalently, every $n$ vertex triangulation has a spanning tree with at least $11n/21$ leaves. Prior to the current work, the best known bounds were $2n/3$ and $n/3$, respectively. (In the special case of Hamiltonian triangulations the previous bounds were $n/2$.)  As an application of this, we show that every $n$-vertex planar graph has a one-bend non-crossing drawing in which some set of at least $11n/21$ vertices is drawn on the $x$-axis.
\end{abstract}

% \vida{Note that if all the vertices of G are on a line then no edge in a 1-bend drawing crosses the line and thus G is subhamiltonian. Since not all planar graphs are subhamiltonian, that implies that the tight bound for the drawings above is strictly less than n. I wonder how much smaller than n it has to be. Is it a fraction of n? Do we know anything about the side of the largest induced subhamiltonian graph in a planar triangulation? Whatever we have on that line induces a subhamiltonian planar graph. So basically the result above also says that each planar graph has induced subgraph of size at least 11n/21 that is subhamiltonian planar. Do not know if that is interesting. n/4 follows trivially from 4-colour theorem. n/2 follows from the fact that every other layer of BFS induced an outerplanar graph.

% In either case we should say that n is not possible (or even better if we know that c*n is not possible for some $c<1$)

% \saeed{As far as I am aware, all we know is Goldner–Harary Graph (\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldner–Harary_graph}) is the smallest triangulation that is not subhamiltonian. you can put 10/11 of the vertices on a line. so the trivial upper bound on the size of the one-bend collinear set is 10/11. It would be interesting if we could glue a lot of copies of this example nicely to get a better upper bound. We conjecture that the size of the connected dominating set is at most $\frac{n}{3}$.  \sout{I guess (might be wrong) that the size of the largest collinear set is also at most $\frac{2n}{3}$.}}

\section{Introduction}

A set $X$ of vertices in a graph $G$ is a \defin{dominating set} if each vertex of $G$ is in $X$ or adjacent to a vertex in $X$.  A dominating set $X$ of $G$ is \defin{connected} if the subgraph $G[X]$ of $G$ induced by $X$ is connected.  There is an enormous body of literature on dominating sets, and several books are devoted to the topic \cite{haynes.hedetniemi.ea:domination,haynes.hedetniemi.ea:topics}.  A typical result in the area is of the form: ``Every $n$-vertex graph in some family $\mathcal{G}$ of graphs has a (connected) dominating set of size at most $f(n)$.'' or ``For infinitely many $n$, there exists an $n$-vertex member of $\mathcal{G}$ with no (connected) dominating set of size less than $g(n)$.''

A \defin{triangulation} is an edge-maximal planar graph.  \citet{matheson.tarjan:dominating} proved that every $n$-vertex triangulation has a dominating set of size at most $n/3=0.33\overline{3}n$ and that there exists $n$-vertex triangulations with no dominating set of size less than $n/4=0.25n$. The gap between these upper and lower bounds stood for over $20$ years until a recent breakthrough by \citet{spacapan:domination} reduced the upper bound to $17n/53\approx 0.32075471698n$.  This was swiftly followed by an improvement to $2n/7\approx 0.2\overline{857142}n$ by \citet{christiansen.rotenberg.ea:triangulations}.

In the current paper, we consider connected dominating sets in triangulations.  An easy consequence of the proof used by \citet{matheson.tarjan:dominating} is that triangulations have connected dominating sets of size at most $2n/3=0.66\overline{6}n$.  A more general result, due to  \citet{kleitman.west:spanning} shows that graphs of minimum-degree $3$ in which each edge is included in a $3$-cycle have connected dominating set of size at most $2(n-5)/3<0.66\overline{6}n$.  \citet{kleitman.west:spanning} also show that graphs of minimum degree $4$ have connected dominating sets of size at most $(3n-8)/5<0.6n$. This result applies to triangulations of minimum degree $4$, which includes all $4$-connected triangulations.  The main result in this paper is the following:

\begin{thm}\label{main_result2}
  For every $n\ge 4$, every $n$-vertex triangulation $G$ has a connected dominating set $X$ of size at most $10n/21= 0.\overline{476190}n$.
\end{thm}

The proof of \cref{main_result2} is constructive and gives an $O(n)$ time algorithm for finding the set $X$.  As far as we know, the best lower bound for this problem is $n/3-2 < 0.33\overline{3} n$, obtained from any triangulation that contains $n/3$ vertex-disjoint pairwise-nested triangles $\Delta_1,\ldots,\Delta_{n/3}$.  In order to dominate $\Delta_1$, any dominating set must contain at least one vertex in $\Delta_1 \cup \Delta_2$. In order to dominate $\Delta_{n/3}$, any dominating set must contain a vertex in $\Delta_{n/3-1}\cup\Delta_{n/3}$.  In order to be connected, any connected dominating set must contain a vertex in each $\Delta_2,\ldots,\Delta_{n/3-1}$.

\saeed{we can force the structure between $\Delta_1$ and $\Delta_2$ s.t. we need 2 vertices from $\Delta_1 \cup \Delta_2$ in the dominating set}


The original motivation for this research was a graph drawing problem.  It is know that every $n$-vertex planar graph $G$ has a non-crossing drawing in the plane with edges of $G$ drawn as line segments and such that some set $Y$ of $\Omega(n^{1/2})$ vertices of $G$ are drawn on the $x$-axis \cite{bose.dujmovic:polynomial,dujmovic:utility}.  The set $Y$ is called a \defin{collinear set}.  For bounded-degree planar graphs, this result can be improved to $|Y|=\Omega(n^{0.8})$ \cite{dujmovic.morin:dual}.  Determining the supremum value of $\alpha$ such that every $n$-vertex planar graph has a collinear set of size $\Omega(n^{\alpha})$ remains a difficult open problem, but it is known that $\alpha < 1$ \cite{ravsky.verbitsky:collinear}.

We consider a relaxation of this problem in which the edges of the graph can be drawn as a polygonal path consisting of at most two line segments.  Such a drawing is called a \defin{$1$-bend} drawing of $G$.  A subset $Y$ of $V(G)$ is a \defin{$1$-bend collinear set} if $G$ has a $1$-bend drawing in which all vertices of $Y$ appear on the $x$-axis.  We show that, for any connected dominating set $X$ in a triangulation $G$, the set $Y:=V(G)\setminus X$ is a $1$-bend collinear set of $G$.  Combined with \cref{main_result2}, this gives:

\begin{thm}\label{one_bend_collinear}
  For every $n\ge 4$, every $n$-vertex planar graph has a $1$-bend collinear set of size at least $11n/21=0.\overline{523809}n$.
\end{thm}

Note that if all the vertices of $G$ are on the $x$-axis then no edge in a $1$-bend drawing of $G$ crosses the $x$-axis, so this one bend drawing is a $2$-page book-embedding of $G$. This implies that $G$ is a spanning subgraph of some Hamiltonian triangulation $G^+$.  The Goldner–Harary graph is an $11$-vertex triangulation that is not Hamiltonian. It follows that the graph $G$ obtained by taking $k$ vertex-disjoint copies of the Goldner-Harary graph has $n:=11k$ vertices and has no $1$-bend collinear set of size greater than $10k=10n/11=0.90\overline{90}n$.

For every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, Everett et al. \cite{DBLP:conf/gd/EverettLLW07} show that there exists a universal set $\mathcal{U}_n$ of $n$ distinct points in the plane such that every $n$-vertex planar graph admits a 1-bend drawing with vertices on the points of set $\mathcal{U}_n$. Furthermore, Giacomo et al. \cite{DBLP:journals/comgeo/GiacomoDLW05} demonstrate that for a linear ordering $L$ of vertices of a planar triangulation $G$ and strictly convex curve $\lambda$, there is a $1$-bend plane drawing of $G$ such that vertices of $G$ appear on $\lambda$ with the same order as in $L$.

With further relaxation on the drawing of the edges, de Fraysseix et al. \cite{DBLP:journals/combinatorica/FraysseixPP90} show that any set of $n$ points in the plane is a universal set for the 2-bend drawing of planar graphs. Furthermore, They show that the planar embedding problem of any $n$-vertex graph on an $n$ collinear points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ with at most one bend along each edge is NP-complete.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows:  In \cref{strategy}, we describe the general strategy we use for finding connected dominating sets in triangulations.  In \cref{warm_up} we show that a simple version of this strategy can be used to obtain a connected dominating set of size at most $4n/7= 0.\overline{571428}n$, which is already better than the best known bounds for triangulations.  In \cref{full_result} we show that a more careful construction leads to a proof of \cref{main_result2}.  In \cref{one_bend}, we discuss the connection between connected dominating sets and one-bend collinear drawings that leads to \cref{one_bend_collinear}.

\section{The General Strategy}
\label{strategy}

For a graph $G$, let $|G|=|V(G)|$ denote the number of vertices of $G$.  A \defin{bridge} in a graph $G$ is an edge $e$ of $G$ such that $G-e$ has more connected components than $G$.  For a vertex $v\in G$, $N_G(v):=\{w\in V(G):vw\in E(G)\}$ is the \defin{open neighbourhood} of $v$ in $G$,  $N_G[v]:=N_G(v)\cup\{v\}$ is the \defin{closed neighbourhood} of $v$ in $G$.  For a vertex subset $S\subseteq V(G)$, $N_G[S]:=\bigcup_{v\in S} N_{G}[v]$ is the \defin{closed neighbourhood} of $S$ in $G$ and $N_G(S):=N_G[S]\setminus S$ is the \defin{open neighbourhood} of $S$ in $G$.  A set $X\subseteq V(G)$ \defin{dominates} a set $B\subseteq V(G)$ if $B\subseteq N_G[X]$.  Thus, $X$ is a dominating set of $G$ if and only if $X$ dominates $V(G)$.

A \defin{plane graph} is a graph equipped with a non-crossing embedding in $\mathbb{R}^2$.  A plane graph is \defin{outerplane} if all its vertices appear on the outer face.  A \defin{triangle} is a cycle of length $3$. A \defin{near-triangulation} is a plane graph whose outer face is bounded by a cycle and whose inner faces are all bounded by triangles.  A \defin{generalized near-triangulation} is a plane graph whose inner faces are bounded by triangles. Note that a generalized near triangulation may have multiple components, cut vertices, and bridges


For a plane graph $H$, we use the notation $B(H)$ to denote the vertex set of the outer face of $H$ and define $I(H):=V(H)\setminus B(H)$.  The vertices in $B(H)$ are \defin{boundary vertices} of $H$ and the vertices in $I(G)$ are \defin{inner vertices} of $H$. For any vertex $v$ of $H$, the \defin{inner neighbourhood} of $v$ in $H$ is defined as $N_H^+(v):=N_H(v)\cap I(H)$, the vertices in $N^+_H(v)$ are \defin{inner neighbours} of $v$ in $H$, and $\deg^+_H(v)=|N^+_H(v)|$ is the \defin{inner degree} of $v$ in $H$.

Let $G$ be a triangulation.  Our procedure for constructing a connected dominating set $X$ begins with an incremental phase that eats away at the triangulation $G$ ``from the outside.'' The process of constructing $X$ is captured by the following definition:   A vertex subset $X\subseteq V(G)$ is \defin{outer-domatic} if it can be partitioned into non-empty subsets $\Delta_0,\Delta_1,\ldots,\Delta_{r-1}$ such that
\begin{compactenum}[(P1)]
    \item $\Delta_0\subseteq B(G)$; \label{outer_face}
    \item $\Delta_i\subseteq B(G-(\bigcup_{j=0}^{i-1}\Delta_j))$ for each $i\in\{1,\ldots,r-1\}$; and \label{incremental}
    \item $G-(\bigcup_{j=0}^{r-1}\Delta_j)$ is outerplanar. \label{outerplanar}
\end{compactenum}

\begin{lem}\label{outer_domatic}
    Let $G$ be a triangulation.  Then any outer-domatic $X\subseteq V(G)$ is a connected dominating set of $G$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
  Suppose $X$ is outer-domatic and let $\Delta_0,\ldots,\Delta_{r-1}$ be the corresponding partition of $X$.  For each $i\in\{1,\ldots,r\}$, let $X_i:=\bigcup_{j=0}^{i-1} \Delta_i$.  First observe that, since $\Delta_0\subseteq B(G)$ is non-empty, $X_i$ contains at least one vertex of $B(G)$, for each $i\in\{1,\ldots,r\}$. We claim that,
  \begin{compactenum}[(P1)]\setcounter{enumi}{3}
    \item for each $i\in\{2,\ldots,r\}$ each vertex in $B(G-X_{i-1})$ is adjacent to some vertex in $X_{i-1}$. \label{adjacent}
  \end{compactenum}
  Indeed, for any $i\in\{2,\ldots,r\}$ and any vertex $v\in B(G-X_{i-1})$ is either in $B(G)$ or adjacent to a vertex in $X_{i-1}$. Even in the former case, (P1) ensures that $v$ is adjacent to a vertex in $X_1=\Delta_0\subseteq X_{i-1}$, because $G[B(G)]$ is a clique.

  We now prove, by induction on $i$, that $G[X_i]$ is connected, for each $i\in\{1,\ldots,r\}$.
  The fact that $G[B(G)]$ is a clique and \pref{outer_face} implies that $G[X_1]=G[\Delta_0]$ is connected. For each $i\in\{2,\ldots,r\}$, the assumption that $G[X_{i-1}]$ is connected, \pref{incremental}, and \pref{adjacent} then imply that $G[X_i]=G[X_{i-1}\cup\Delta_{i-1}]$ is connected.

  In particular $G[X_r]=G[X]$ is connected.  Finally, \pref{adjacent}, with $i=r$ and \pref{outerplanar} implies that $N_G(X_r)=B(G-X_r)=V(G-X_r)$, so $X_r=X$ is a dominating set of $G$.
\end{proof}

We will present two algorithms that grow a connected dominating in small batches $\Delta_0,\Delta_1,\ldots,\Delta_{r-2}$ that result in a sequence of sets $X_1,\ldots,X_{r-1}$ where $X_{i}=\bigcup_{j=0}^{i-1}\Delta_j$.  Each of these algorithms is unable to continue once they reach a point where each vertex in $B(G-X_i)$ has inner-degree at most $1$ in $G-X_i$.  We begin by studying the graphs that cause this to happen.

\subsection{Critical Graphs}

A generalized near-triangulation $H$ is \defin{critical} if $\deg^+_H(v)\le 1$ for each $v\in B(H)$. We that an inner face of $H[B(H)]$ is \defin{marked} if it contains an inner vertex of $H$.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[page=1]{figs/critical}
    \caption{Some critical graphs.}
    \label{critical_fig}
\end{figure}


\begin{lem}\label{critical_structure}
    Let $H$ be a critical generalized near-triangulation. Then each $f$ face of $H[B(H)]$ contains at most one vertex of $I(H)$ and this vertex is adjacent to every vertex of $f$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
  By definition, the graph $H[B]$ is outerplanar.  Consider some marked face $f$ of $H[B]$.  This face is marked because it contains at least one vertex in $I$.  Since $H$ is a triangulation, there is an edge $vx$ in $H$ with $v\in B$ on the boundary of $f$ and $x\in I$ in the interior of $f$. Since $H$ is a generalized near-triangulation and $x$ is an inner vertex of $H$, the edge $vx$ is on the boundary of two faces $vxv_1$ and $vxv_{k-1}$ of $H$ with $v_1\neq v_{k-1}$.  Since $\deg^+_H(v)=1$, each of $v_1$ and $v_{k-1}$ are in $B$.  By the same argument, $H$ contains a face $v_1xv_2$ with $v_2\in B$, $v_2\neq v$, and repeating this argument shows that $v,v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_{k-1}$ is the cycle in $H[B]$ that bounds $f$.  Therefore, $f$ contains exactly one vertex $x$ of $I$ and $x$ is adjacent to each vertex of $f$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lem}\label{base_case}
    Let $H$ be a critical generalized near-triangulation. Then $|B(H)|\ge 3|I(H)|$ and there exists $\Delta\subseteq B(H)$ of size at most $|I(H)|$ that dominates $I(H)$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
  Let $B:=B(H)$ and $I:=I(H)$.  If $I$ is empty then the result is trivially true, by taking $X:=\emptyset$, so we now assume that $I$ is non-empty.  By \cref{critical_structure}, $H$ is formed from the outerplanar graph $H[B]$ by adding $|I|$ stars, one in the interior of each marked face of $H[B]$.  Furthermore, since $\deg_H^+(v)=1$ for each $v\in B$, each vertex of $H[B]$ is on the boundary of exactly one marked face.  For each vertex $w\in I$, the marked face that $f$ of $H[B]$ that contains $w$ has at least $3$ vertices, which do not belong to any other marked face. Therefore $|B|\ge 3|I|$ and by choosing one vertex from each marked face of $H[B]$ we obtain the desired set $\Delta$.
\end{proof}

% \begin{lem}\label{two_critical_helper}
%   Let $H$ be a biconnected critical generalized near-triangulation with at least two vertices.  Then $H[B(H)]$ has a proper $3$-colouring such that
%   \begin{compactenum}[(i)]
%     \item For each face $f$ of $H[B(H)]$ each colour appeas at least once;
%     \item For each marked face $f$ of $H[B(H)]$, there is a vertex $v_f$ whose colour is different from every other vertex in $f$.
%   \end{compactenum}
% \end{lem}
%
% \begin{proof}
%  The proof is by induction on the number $p$ of inner faces of $H[B(H)]$ with four or more vertices.  If $p=0$ then $H=H[B(H)]$ is an edge-maximal outerplanar graph and $H$ has a proper $3$-colouring that easily satisifies the conditions of the lemma.
%
%  Otherwise, let $f$ be a face of $H[B(H)]$ with four or more vertices. Then, by \cref{critical_structure}, the interior of $f$ contains a single vertex $x\in I(H)$ that is adjacent to every vertex in $f$.  Let $H'$
%
%  Otherwise, let $v$ be a vertex in $I(H)$ and let
%
%
%
%  If $|H|=3$ then, since $H$ is connected and bridgeless, $H$ is a cycle $vrw$. Then the conditions of the lemma are easily satisfied with $X_0:=\{v\}$, $X_1:=\{r\}$, and $X_2:=\{w\}$.  We now assume that $|H|\ge 3$.
%
%   % If $r$ has degree $1$, then let $r'$ be the unique neighbour of $r$ in $H$ and let $H':=H-r$.  Then $r'\in B(H')$ so we apply the inductive hypothesis on the instance $(H',r')$ to obtain sets $X_0',X_1',X_2'$ where $r'\in X_1'$, each of $X_1'$ and $X_2'$ dominate $V(H')$ and $X_0'$ dominates $V(H')\setminus \{r'\}$. Then we take $X_0:=X_{2}'$, $X_1:=X_0'\cup\{r'\}$ and $X_2:=X_1'$.  Then $X_1$ dominates $V(H)$ since $X_0'$ dominates $V(H)\setminus\{r,r'\}$ and $N_H[r]=\{r,r'\}$. Since $r'\in X_1'$, $X_2$ also dominates $V(H)$. The final set $X_0=X_2'$ dominates $V(H')=V(H)\setminus\{r\}$, as required.
%
%   If $r$ is a cut vertex of $H$, then $H-r$ has $k\ge 2$ components $C_1,\ldots,C_k$. For each $i\in\{1,\ldots,k\}$, let $H_i:=H[V(C_i)\cup\{r\}]$ and observe that $r\in B(H_i)$.  For each $i\in\{1,\ldots,k\}$,  we apply the inductive hypothesis on the instance $(H_i,r)$ to obtaine three sets $X_{i,0},X_{i,1},X_{i,2}$. Then, for each $i\in\{1,\ldots,k\}$,  $r\in X_{i,1}$, each of $X_{i,1}$ and $X_{i,2}$ dominate $V(H_i)$, and $X_{i,0}$ dominates $V(H_i)\setminus\{r\}$.  Then taking $X_0:=\bigcup_{i=1}^k X_{i,0}$,$X_1:=\bigcup_{i=1}^k X_{i,1}$, and $X_2:=\bigcup_{i=1}^k X_{i,2}$ gives the desired subsets of vertices.
%
%   If $\deg^+H(r)=1$ then let $f$ be the face of $H[B]$ that contains the single vertex $x\in N_H(r)\cap I$. Let $H'$ be the graph obtrained from $H$ by contracting the edge $rx$, creating a new vertex $r'$.  Then we apply the inductive hypothesis on the instance $(H',r')$ to obtain sets $X_0'$, $X_1'$, and $X_2'$ where $r'\in X_1'$, $X_1'$ and $X_2'$ dominate $V(H')$ and $X_0'$ dominates $V(H')\setminus\{r'\}$.
%
%
%   .  Without loss of generality, $r'\in X_1'$, each of $X_1'$ ad $X_2'$ dominate $V(H')$ and $X_0'$ dominates $V(H)\setminus\{r'
%   \}$.
%
%
%   Otherwise, suppose $r$ is not

%   Otherwise, $r$ is a vertex on the boundary of some inner face $f$ of $H[B]$.  If $f$ is a triangle $vrw$, then let $

\section{A Simple Algorithm}
\label{warm_up}

We start with the simplest possible greedy algorithm, that we call $\textsc{SimpleGreedy}(G)$, to choose $\Delta_0,\ldots,\Delta_{r-1}$.  Suppose we have already chosen $\Delta_0,\ldots,\Delta_{i-1}$ for some $i\ge 0$ and we now want to choose $\Delta_i$.  Let $X_i:=\bigcup_{j=0}^{i-1}\Delta_j$, let $G_i:=G-X_i$, and let $v_i$ be a vertex in $B(G_i)$ that maximizes $\deg^+_{G_i}(v_i)$.  During iteration $i\ge 0$, there are only two cases to consider:
\begin{compactenum}[{[}g1{]}]
    \item If $\deg^+_{G_i}(v_i)\ge 2$ then we set $\Delta_i\gets\{v_i\}$.
    \item If $\deg^+_{G_i}(v_i)\le 1$ for all $v\in G_i$ then $G_i$ is critical and this is the final step, so $r:=i+1$.  By \cref{base_case}, there exists $\Delta_i\subseteq B_i$ of size at most $|I_i|$ that dominates $I_i$. Then $X_r:=X_{r-1}\cup\Delta_{i}$ and we are done.
\end{compactenum}

\begin{thm}\label{simple_greedy}
  When applied to an $n$-vertex triangulation $G$,  $\textsc{SimpleGreedy}(G)$ produces a connected dominating set $X_r$ of size at most $(4n-9)/7$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
By the choice of $\Delta_0,\ldots,\Delta_{r-1}$, $X_r$ is an outer-domatic subset of $V(G)$ so, by \cref{outer_domatic}, $X_r$ is a connected dominating set of $G$.  All that remains is to analyze the size of $X_r$.  For each $i\in\{1,\ldots,r\}$, let $D_i:=N_G[X_i]$ be the subset of $V(G)$ that is dominated by $X_i$, let $I_i:=V(G)\setminus D_i$ be the subset of $V(G)$ not dominated by $X_i$, and let $B_i:=N_G(I_i)$ be the vertices of $G$ that have at least one neighbour in each of $X_i$ and $I_i$.  We use the convention that $D_0:=B(G)$.

First observe that, for $i\in\{0,\ldots,r-2\}$, $|D_{i+1}|\ge |D_i|+\deg_{G_i}^+(v_i)$ since $D_{i+1}\supseteq D_i$ and $D_{i+1}$ contains the $\deg_{G_i}^+(v_i)$ inner neighbours of $v_i$ in $G_i$.  Therefore
\[
    |D_{r-1}| \ge |D_0| + \sum_{i=0}^{r-2} \deg_{G_i}^+(v_i) \ge 3 + \sum_{i=0}^{r-2} 2 =  2r+1 \enspace . \label{double_d}
\]
Since $D_{r-1}$ and $I_{r-1}$ partition $V(G)$,
\begin{equation}
  n = |D_{r-1}| + |I_{r-1}| \ge 2r+1 + |I_{r-1}|  \enspace . \label{c1}
\end{equation}

Since $X_{r-1}$ and $B_{r-1}$ are disjoint and $D_{r-1}\supseteq B_{r-1}\cup X_{r-1}$, we have $|D_{r-1}|\ge |X_{r-1}| + |B_{r-1}|=r-1+|B_{r-1}|$.  Therefore,
\begin{align}
    n & = |D_{r-1}| + |I_{r-1}| \ge r-1 + |B_{r-1}| + |I_{r-1}| = r-1 + |B_{r-1}| + |I_{r-1}| \notag
    \\
    & \ge r - 1 + 4|I_{r-1}| \enspace , \label{c2}
\end{align}
where the last inequality follows from \cref{base_case}.

The final dominating set $X_r$ has size $|X_r| = |X_{r-1}| + \Delta_{r-1} = r - 1 +|I_{r-1}|$, so the size of $|X_r|$ can be upper-bounded by maximizing $r-1+|I_{r-1}|$ subject to \cref{c1,c2}.  More precisely, by setting $x:=r$ and $y:=|I_{r-1}|$, the maximum size of $X_r$ is upper-bounded by the maximum value of $x-1+y$ subject to the constraints
\begin{align*}
x,y \ge 0 \\
  x - 1 + 4y & \le n \\
  2x + 1 + y & \le n
\end{align*}

% r\le (n+1-I_{r-1})/2$ and $r+4|I_{r-1}|\le n$.
This is an easy linear programming exercise and the maximum value of $X_{r}$ is obtained when $r=(3n-5)/7$ and $|I_{r-1}|=(n+3)/7$, which gives
$|X_r| \le (4n-9)/7$.
\end{proof}

\subsection{An $O(n)$ Time Implementation}

We note that the implementation of $\textsc{SimpleGreedy}(G)$ is even simpler than the definition given above.  Nothing special needs to be done for the critical graph $G_{r-1}$.  Repeatedly selecting a vertex of maximum innner-degree and removing it will produce a dominating set of size exactly $|I_{r-1}|$.  Thus, $\textsc{SimpleGreedy}(G)$ has a simple linear time implementation.  In this implementation, each vertex $v$ stores a value $d_v$ which is initially set to $\deg_G(v)$.  For the three vertices on the outer face of $G$, $d_v$ is initially set to $\deg_G(v)-2$.  In general, $d_v$ is kept updated so that it is always equal to the inner-degree of $v$ in $G_i$.

Besides the data structure used for representing the triangulation $G$, each vertex $v$ also participates in a doubly-linked list $L_{d_v}$  that stores all the vertices with the same $d_v$ value.  A global doubly-linked list $L$ then stores all the lists $L_d$ such that $L_d$ is non-empty, sorted by increasing order of $d$.   Extracting a vertex of maximum inner-degree can then be done in constant time and the total time spent moving vertices between different lists in $L$ is proportional to the number of edges of $G$. Thus, the entire algorithm can be implemented in $O(n)$ time.

\section{A Better Algorithm}
\label{full_result}

Next we devise an algorithm that produces a smaller connected dominating set than what $\textsc{SimpleGreedy}(G)$ can guarantee.  This involves a more careful analysis of the cases in which \textsc{SimpleGreedy} is forced to take a vertex $v_i$ with $\deg^+_{G_i}(v_i)=2$.  We will show that when this happens, one of the following two cases occurs:
\begin{compactenum}
  \item We can directly complete the dominating set $X_r=X_{i+1}$ by adding a set $\Delta_{r-1}=\Delta_i$ with at most $|G_i|/3$ additional vertices.
  \item We can add a pair of vertices $\{v_i,w_i\}$ that increase the size of the dominated set $D_{i+1}=N[X_{i+1}]$ by at least $5$ but only increase the size of the boundary set $B_{i+1}=B(G_{i+1})$ by at most $2$.
\end{compactenum}

% The commented out text below turns out to be completely bullshit
% \subsection{A Heuristic Analysis}
% Before diving into the details of how to make all this work, we present a heuristic analysis that explains why it gives a set $X$ of size at most $10n/21$.  Roughly speaking, Case~1 above implies that each vertex left in $G_{r-1}$ contributes $1/3$ to the size of the final dominating set $X_r$.  This implies that Case~2 above is more efficient than taking a vertex of inner-degree $3$.  Indeed, Case~1 adds two vertices $v_i$ and $y_i$ and increases the size of the boundary by $2$.  If the algorithm were to stop in the next iteration, these two new boundary vertices would contribute an additional $2/3$ to the size of $X_r$. Thus, Case~1 has a cost of $2+2/3=8/3$.  On the other hand, Case~1 decreases the number of undominated vertices by $5$, which is a measure of its progress.  On the other hand, choosing a vertex of inner-degree $3$ adds one vertex to $X$ and increases the size of the boundary by $2$, resulting in a cost of $1+2/3=5/3$ but only decreases the number of undominated vertices by $3$.  If we consider the ``progress over cost ratio'', the former case has a ratio of $5/(8/3)=15/8=1.875$ while the latter case has a ratio of $3/(5/3)=1.8$. We will formalize this informal argument by setting up a linear program to bound the maximum size of the final dominating set $X_r$. \pat{Maybe we can turn this informal argument into a potential function argument, instead?}

% In the end, optimizing this linear program shows that they hypothetical worst-case for the resulting algorithm is that it chooses inner-degree $3$ vertices for the first $r-1$ consecutive rounds, resulting in a graph $G_{r-1}$ with $|B(G_{r-1})|\approx 2r$ and $|I(G_{r-1})|\approx n-3r$, so $|G_{r-1}|\approx 2r+n-3r=n-r$.  The algorithm then finishes in Case~1, above, by taking a set $\Delta_{r-1}$ of size $|G_{r-1}|\approx (n-r)/3$.  This results in a dominating set $X_r$ of size roughly $r+(n-r)/3=n/3+(2/3)r$. This is a strictly increasing function of $r$, but the value of $r$ is constrained by the fact that $G_{r-1}$ has no vertices of inner-degree $3$, which implies that $|B(G_{r-1})|\ge |I(G_{r-1})|$.  This translates to the constraint $2r \le n-3r$ or $r \le n/5$.  Thus, the final dominating set has size at most $n/3 + (2/3)n/5=10n/21$.  We now make this heuristic analysis more formal.

\subsection{Dom-Minimal and Dom-Preserving Subgraphs}

We begin by identifying unnecessary vertices and edges that can appear in the graphs $G_1,\ldots,G_{r-1}$ during the construction of $X$.   We say that a near-triangulation $H$ is \defin{dom-minimal} if
\begin{compactenum}[({DM}1)]
    \item each vertex $v\in B(H)$ has $\deg^+_H(v)\ge 1$; and \label[dm]{bad_vertex}
    \item each edge $vw$ on the boundary of the outer face of $H$ is on the boundary an inner face $vwx$ of $H$ for some $x\in I(H)$. \label[dm]{bad_edge}
\end{compactenum}
We say that a generalized near-triangulation $H$ is \defin{dom-minimal} if each of its biconnected components are dom-minimal.

\begin{obs}\label{bridgeless}
    Any dom-minimal generalized near-triangulation $H$ is bridgeless.
\end{obs}

\begin{proof}
   If $vw$ is a bridge in $H$ then both $v$ and $w$ are in $B(H)$.  Since $vw$ is a bridge in $H$, there is no path $vxw$ in $H$ and hence no inner face $vwx$ in $H$. Thus $H$ does not satisfy \cref{bad_edge}.
\end{proof}

A subgraph $H'$ of a generalized near-triangulation $H$ is \defin{dom-preserving} if
\begin{compactenum}[({DP}1)]
  \item $B(H')\subseteq B(H)$;
  \item $N^+_{H'}(v)=N^+_H(v)$ for all $v\in B(H')$;
  \item $I(H')=I(H)$; and
  \item $N_{H'}(v)=N_H(v)$ for all $v\in I(H)$.
\end{compactenum}

\begin{obs}
  Let $H$ be a generalized near-triangulation, let $H'$ be a dom-preserving subgraph of $H$, and let $\Delta$ be a subset of $V(H)$ that dominates $I(H)$.  Then $\Delta\cap V(H')$ dominates $I(H)$.
\end{obs}

\begin{proof}
  Each vertex $v\in I(H)=I(H')$ is adjacent to some vertex $w\in \Delta$.  Since $N_{H'}(v)=N_H(v)$, $w\in\Delta\cap V(H')$, so $v$ is dominated by $\Delta\cap V(H')$.  Since this is true for each $v\in I(H)=I(H')$, $\Delta\cap V(H')$ dominates $I(H)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lem}\label{dom_minimal}
  For any generalized near-triangulation $H$, there exists a dom-preserving subgraph $H'$ of $H$ that is dom-minimal.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
  The proof is by induction on $|V(H)|+|E(H)|$.  If $H$ is already dom-minimal, then setting $H'=H$ satisfies the requirements of the lemma, so assume that $H$ is not dom-minimal.  It is straightforward to verify that the dom-preserving subgraph relationship is transitive, so if $H$ has a dom-preserving subgraph $H^*$ and $H^*$ has a dom-preserving subgraph $H'$ then $H'$ is a dom-preserving subgraph of $H$.  Therefore, it is sufficient to show the existence of a dom-preserving subgraph $H^*$ of $H$ with fewer edges or fewer vertices than $H$, and the inductive hypothesis provides the desired dom-minimal dom-preserving subgraph $H'$ of $H$.

  If $H$ contains a vertex $v\in B(H)$ with $\deg^+_H(v)=0$ then $H-v$ is a dom-preserving subgraph of $H$ with fewer vertices than $H$.  We now assume that $\deg^+_H(v)\ge 1$ for all $v\in B(H)$.  Since $H$ is not dom-minimal then $H$ contains a biconnected component $C$ that is not dom-minimal.
  \begin{compactenum}
    \item If there exists an edge $vw$ on the outer face of $C$ that is not incident to any inner face $vwx$ with $x\in I(C)$ then $B(H-vw)=B(H)$ and $I(H-vw)=I(H)$, and $H-vw$ is a is dom-preserving subgraph of $H$ that has fewer edges than $H$.

    \item If there exists a vertex $v\in B(C)$ with $\deg^+_C(v)=0$ then $v$ is incident to an edge $vw$ that is on the outer face of $C$ and on the outer face of $H$. Since $\deg^+_C(v)=0$, $vw$ is not incident to any inner face $vwx$ with $x\in I(C)$ and we can proceed as in the previous case. \qedhere
  \end{compactenum}
\end{proof}

% We say that a generalized near-triangulation $H$ is \defin{good} if
% \begin{compactenum}[(G1)]
%       \item $H$ is critical;
%       \item there exists $v\in B(H)$ with $\deg^+_H(v)\ge 3$; or
%       \item there exists distinct $v,w\in B(H)$ such that $\deg^+_H(v)=2$ and $N^+_H(w)\subseteq N^+_H(v)$.
% \end{compactenum}
%
% \begin{lem}\label{not_good}
%   Let $H$ be a dom-minimal generalized near-triangulation.  Then \begin{compactenum}[(i)]
%     \item $H$ is good or
%     \item $B(H)$ contains a vertex $v$ with $\deg^+_H(v)=2$ such that $G-v$ is good.
%   \end{compactenum}
% \end{lem}
%
% \begin{proof}
%   Since $H$ is dom-minimal, each vertex in $B(H)$ has inner-degree greater than $0$.  If some vertex in $B(H)$ has inner-degree at least $3$ then $H$ is good and there is nothing to prove, so we may assume that each vertex in $B(H)$ has inner-degree $1$ or $2$.  Since $H$ is not critical, at least one vertex in $B(H)$ has inner-degree $2$.  We distinguish between two cases, depending on whether $H$ is biconnected.
%
%   \pat{Updated here. The case where $H$ is biconnected needs a separate argument when $k=3$.}
%   If $H$ is biconnected then, since $H$ is bridgeless (by \cref{bridgeless}) the outer face of $C$ is a cycle $v_0,\ldots,v_{k-1}$ with $k\ge 3$. If there exists an edge $v_iv_{i+1}$ of this cycle with $\deg^+_H(v_i)=2$ and $\deg^+_H(v_{i+1})=1$ then $N_H^+(v_{i+1})\subset N_H^+(v_i)$ and $H$ is good, so we may assume that $\deg^+_H(v_i)=2$ for all $i\in\{0,\ldots,k-1\}$.
%   Let $v_i$ be a vertex in $B(H)$ such that $N_H(v_i)=N_H^+(v_i)\cup\{v_{i-1},v_{i+1}\}$.  Without loss of generality, assume $i=0$. Now consider the graph $H'=H-v_0$.  This graph contains two vertices, namely $v_{1}$ and $v_{k-1}$ with inner-degree $1$.  If $k\ge 4$, then $H'$ is good, because $\deg_{H'}^+(v_2)=2$ and $N^+_{H'}(v_1)\subseteq N^+_{H'}(v_2)$.  Otherwise, the outer face of $H'$ is a $4$-cycle $x_1,x_2,v_1,v_2$ and $N_H^+(v_1)\subseteq N_H^+(x_2)$ and $N_H^+(v_2)\subseteq N_H^+(x_1)$.  If $\deg^+_H(x_2)\ge 2$ or $\deg^+_H(x_1)\ge 2$ then $H'$ is good.  Otherwise all vertices in $B(H')$ have inner-degree at most $1$ in $H'$, so $H'$ is also good. Therefore $H$ contains a vertex $v:=v_0$ such that $H-v$ is good, as required.
%
%
%
%   If $H$ is not biconnected, then let $C$ be a biconnected component of $H$ that contains a single cut-vertex $v_0$ of $H$ (so $C$ is a leaf in the block-cut tree of $H$). Then $v_0$ is contained in a second biconnected component $C'\neq C$ of $H$. Since $H$ is dom-minimal, $\deg^+_{C}(v_0)\ge 1$ and $\deg^+_{C'}(v_0)\ge 1$, so $\deg^+_H(v)= 2$.
%
%   Since $C$ is biconnected, its outer face is bounded by a cycle $v_0,v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_{k-1}$.  If $\deg^+_C(v_1)=1$ then, since $H$ is dom-minimal, the edge $v_0v_1$ is on the boundary of an inner face $v_0v_1x$ with $x\in I(H)$.  Since $v_0$ is the only cut-vertex of $H$ in $C$, $N^+_H(v_1)=N^+_C(v_1)=\{x\}\subseteq N_H(v_0)$ and $\deg^+_H(v_0)=2$, so $H$ is good and there is nothing to prove.  We may therefore  assume that $\deg^+_C(v_1)=2$ and,  by the same reasoning, that $\deg^+_C(v_i)=2$ for each $i\in\{1,\ldots,k-1\}$.  (Otherwise, $N^+_H(v_i)\subseteq N^+_H(v_{i-1})$ and $\deg^+_H(v_{i-1})=2$ for some $i\in\{2,\ldots,k-1\}$ so $H$ is good.)
%
%   To summarize, so far we know that some vertex $x\in I(H)$ is in $N^+_H(v_0)$, $N^+_H(v_1)$, and $N^+_H(v_{k-1})$.  If $k=3$ then, since $H$ is dom-minimal, $H$ contains a face $v_1v_{k-1}y$ with $y\in I(H)$.  Since $\deg^+_H(v_1)=\deg^+_H(v_{k-1})=2$, $y\neq x$ and $N^+_H(v_1)=N^+_H(v_2)=\{x,y\}$. Again, this implies that $H$ is good.  We now assume that $k\ge 4$.
%
%   The edge $v_1v_2$ is on the boundary of a face $v_1v_2y$.  Since $\deg^+_H(v_1)=2$, $x\neq y$.  If $N^+_H(v_1)=N^+_H(v_2)=\{x,y\}$ then $v_1$ and $v_2$ satisfy (GM3), so $H$ is good.  Otherwise, consider the graph $H':=H-v_0$.  Then $\deg^+_{H'}(v_1)=1$, $\deg^+_{H'}(v_2)=2$, and $N_{H'}(v_1)\subseteq N_{H'}(v_2)$.   Therefore $H'$ is good, so $H$ contains a vertex $v=v_0$ of inner-degree $2$ such that $H-v$ is good.  This completes the proof.
% \end{proof}
%
%
% This gives variant of the $\textsc{SimpleGreedy}(G)$ that we call $\textsc{BetterGreedy}(G)$.  Suppose we have already chosen $\Delta_0,\ldots,\Delta_{i-1}$ for some $i\ge 0$ and we now want to choose $\Delta_i$.  Let $X_i:=\bigcup_{j=0}^{i-1}\Delta_j$, let $G_i$ be a dom-preserving subgraph of $G-X_i$ that is dom-minimal, and let $v_i$ be a vertex in $B(G_i)$ that maximizes $\deg^+_{G_i}(v_i)$.  During iteration $i\ge 0$, there are now four cases to consider:
% \begin{compactenum}
%     \item If $\deg^+_{G_i}(v_i)\ge 3$ then we set $\Delta_i\gets\{v_i\}$.
%     \item If there exists distinct $v_i,w\in B(H)$ such that $\deg^+_H(v_i)=2$ and $N^+_H(w)\subseteq N^+_H(v_i)$ then set $\Delta_i:=\{v_i\}$.
%     \item If $\deg^+_{G_i}(v_i)\le 1$ for all $v\in G_i$ then $G_i$ is critical and this is the final step, so $r:=i+1$.  By \cref{base_case}, there exists $\Delta_i\subseteq B_i$ of size at most $|I_i|$ that dominates $I_i$. Then $X_r:=X_{r-1}+\Delta_{i}$ and we are done.
%     \item Otherwise, $G_i$ is not good.  By \cref{not_good}, $G$ contains a vertex $v_i$ of inner-degree $2$ such that $G-v_i$ is good.  Set $\Delta_i:=\{v_i\}$.
% \end{compactenum}
%
% \begin{thm}\label{better_greedy}
%   When applied to an $n$-vertex triangulation $G$,  $\textsc{BetterGreedy}(G)$ produces a connected dominating set $X_r$ of size at most $(7n-14)/13$.
% \end{thm}
%
% \begin{proof}
%   Let $x_2$ be the number of times $\textsc{BetterGreedy}(G)$ falls into Case~4.
%   For each integer $t\ge 3$, let $x_t$ be the number of times $\textsc{BetterGreedy}(G)$ falls into case $1$ and chooses $v_i$ such that $\deg^+_{G_i}(v_i)=t$.  Let $z$ be the number of times $\textsc{BetterGreedy}(G)$ falls into Case~2.  From \cref{not_good}, we know that Case~4 never occurs during two consecutive iterations.  Therefore,
%   \begin{equation}
%       x_2 \le \sum_{t\ge 3}x_t + z + 1 \enspace .  \label{a1}
%   \end{equation}
%   The size of the dominated set $D_{r-1}$ is at least $|D_{r-1}| \ge 3 + \sum_{t\ge 2}tx_t + 2z$.
%   Since $|D_{r-1}|+|I_{r-1}|=n$,
%   \begin{equation}
%    3 + \sum_{t\ge 2}tx_t + 2z + I_{r-1} \le |D_{r-1}| + I_{r-1} \le n  \enspace . \label{a2}
%   \end{equation}
%   The of the boundary $B_{r-1}$ is at most $|B_{r-1}|\le 3+\sum_{t\ge 2}(t-1)x_t$.
%   By \cref{base_case},
%   \begin{equation}
%     3+\sum_{t\ge 2}(t-1)x_t \ge |B_{r-1}| \ge 3|I_{r-1}| \label{a3}
%   \end{equation}
%   The size of the final set $X_{r}$ is
%   \begin{equation}
%     |X_r| = \sum_{t\ge 2}x_t + z + |I_{r-1}| \enspace . \label{objective2}
%   \end{equation}
%   The unbounded number of variables $x_t$, $t\ge 2$ is problematic. We resolve this with the following claim:
%   \begin{clm}
%     In any assignment of non-negative values to $|I_{r-1}|$, $z$, and $x_2,x_3,\ldots$ that maximizes \cref{objective2} subject to \cref{a1,a2,a3}, $x_t=0$ for each $t\ge 3$.
%   \end{clm}
%   \begin{clmproof}
%      If $x_t = c >0$ for some $t\ge 3$, then we can set $x_t\gets 0$, $z\gets z+tc/2$, and $|I_{r-1}|\gets |I_{r-1}|-(t-1)c/3$.  This increases the value of \cref{objective2} by $tc/2-(t-1)c/3 =(t+2)c/6>0$.  The new values still satisfy \cref{a1} because the right hand side of \cref{a1} increases and the left hand side is unchanged.  The new values still satisfy \cref{a2} because the left hand side of \cref{a2} changes by $tc - 2tc/2 = 0$.  The new values still satisfy \cref{a3} because the left and right hand sides of \cref{a3} each decrease by $(t-1)c$.
%   \end{clmproof}
%   Therefore, \cref{a1,a2,a3} are three inequalities in three non-negative variables $x_2$, $z$, and $|I_{r-1}|$.  Maximizing \cref{objective2} subject to these constraints is an easy linear programming exercise that gives $x_2:=(3n-6)/13$, $z=(3n-19)/13$ and $I_{r-1}=(n+11)/13$, which gives $|X_r|= (7n+8)/13$.
% \end{proof}

% \section{The Best Algorithm}
% Let's see if we can beat $\textsc{BetterGreedy}(G)$.
% First, we need to rework our definition of dom-minimal a little bit:
%
% We say that a near-triangulation $H$ is \defin{dom-minimal} if
% \begin{compactenum}[({DM}1)]
%     \item there are no two vertices $v,w\in B(H)$ such that $N^+_H(w)\subseteq N^+_H(v)$; and
%     \item each edge $vw$ on the boundary of the outer face of $H$ is on the boundary of an inner face $vwx$ of $H$ for some $x\in I(H)$.
% \end{compactenum}
% We say that a generalized near-triangulation $H$ is \defin{dom-minimal} if each of its biconnected components are dom-minimal.
% Note that (DM1) implies that, unless $|H|=1$, each vertex $v\in B(H)$ has $\deg^+_H(v)\ge 1$.
%
% \Cref{bridgeless,dom_minimal} still hold under this new definition of dom-minimal.
%
% \pat{Did I really need to change the definition of dom-minimal?  Check.}


Note that the next two lemmas each consider a graph $H$ that is a near triangulation, not a generalized near-triangulation.

\begin{lem}\label{chord_incident}
  let $H$ be a dom-minimal near-triangulation and let $v_0$ be a vertex in $B(H)$ with $|N_H(v_0)\cap B(H)|\ge 3$.  Then $\deg^+_H(v_0)\ge 2$.  In other words, if $v_0$ is incident to a chord of the outerplane graph $H[B(H)]$, then $v_0$ is incident to at least $2$ inner vertices of $H$.
\end{lem}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics{figs/chord_incident}
  \caption{The proof of \cref{chord_incident}}
  \label{chord_incident_fig}
\end{figure}
\begin{proof}
  Refer to \cref{chord_incident_fig}
  Since $H$ is a near-triangulation its outer face is bounded by a cycle $v_0,\ldots,v_{k-1}$.  Let $a:=\min\{i\in\{2,\ldots,k-2\}:v_0v_i\in E(H)\}$ and $b:=\max\{i\in\{2,\ldots,k-2\}:v_0v_i\in E(H)\}$. (Possibly $a=b$, but both $a$ and $b$ are well-defined since $|N^+_H(v_0)|\ge 3$.)   Since $H$ is dom-minimal, the edge $v_0v_1$ is on the boundary of an inner face $v_0v_1x$ of $H$ where $x$ is an inner vertex of $H$.  Since $H$ is dom-minimal, the edge $v_{k-1}v_0$ is on the boundary of an inner face $v_{k-1}v_0y$ of $H$ where $y$ is an inner vertex of $H$.  Then $x$ is in the interior of the face of $H[B(H)]$ bounded by the cycle $v_0,v_1,\ldots,v_a$ and $y$ is in the interior of the face of $H[B(H)]$ bounded by the cycle $v_0,v_b,\ldots,v_{k-1}$.  Therefore, $x\neq y$ and $N^+_H(v_0)\supseteq\{x,y\}$ so $\deg^+_H(v_0)\ge 2$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lem}\label{degree_2_outer_neighbour}
  Let $H$ be a dom-minimal near-triangulation. Then either:
  \begin{compactenum}
    \item $H$ is outerplane;
    \item $H$ consists of a cycle on the vertices in $B(H)$ plus one dominant inner vertex $w$; or
    \item each vertex $w\in B(H-B(H))$ has a neighbour $v$ in $H$ with $\deg^+_H(v)\ge 2$.
  \end{compactenum}
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
   If $H$ is outerplane then there is nothing to prove, so assume otherwise. Let $w$ be a vertex in $B(H-B(H))$. Since $w\not\in B(H)$, $w$ is an inner vertex of $H$. Consider the face $f:=v_0,\ldots,v_{k-1}$ of the outerplane graph $H[B(H)]$ that contains $w$. See \cref{degree_2_outer_neighbour_fig}.

     \end{tabular}
     \caption{The proof of \cref{degree_2_outer_neighbour}.}
     \label{degree_2_outer_neighbour_fig}
   \end{figure}

   Since $w\in B(H-B(H))$, $w$ is adjacent to at least one vertex, say $v_0$, of $f$.  If $v_0v_{1}$ is a chord of $H[B(H)]$ then, by \cref{chord_incident}, $\deg^+_H(v_0)\ge 2$ and we are done, so assume that $v_0v_{1}$ is not a chord of $H[B(H)]$.  Since $H$ is dom-minimal, $H$ contains an inner face $v_0v_{1}x$ where $x$ is an inner vertex of $H$.  If $x\neq w$, then $\deg_H^+(v_0)\ge 2$ and we are done, so assume that $x=w$.  Therefore, $w$ is adjacent to $v_1$.  Thus, by assuming that $\deg^+_H(v_0)\le 2$ and that $v_0w$ is an edge of $H$ we were able to show that $v_0v_1$ is not a chord of $H[B(H)]$ and that $v_0v_1w$ is an inner face of $H$. This latter fact implies that $v_1w$ is an edge of $H$, so we can repeat this argument to establish that $\deg^+_H(v_j)\ge 2$ for some $j\in\{0,\ldots,k-1\}$ or that $v_{j}v_{j+1}$ is not a chord of $H[B(H)]$ and that $v_{j}v_{j+1}w$ is an inner face of $H$ for all $j\in\{0,\ldots,k-1\}$.  In the first case we are obviously done. In the latter case, $H$ is the graph described in the second alternative given by the lemma.
\end{proof}


Note that the next three lemmas consider the case where $H$ is a generalized near triangulation.

\begin{lem}\label{really_good}
  Let $H$ be a dom-minimal generalized near-triangulation.  Then either:
  \begin{compactenum}[(1)]
    \item $H-B(H)$ is critical; \label[p]{two_critical}
    \item $B(H)$ contains a vertex $v$ with $\deg^+_H(v)\ge 3$; or \label[p]{degree_three}
    \item $H$ contains distinct vertices $v_0$, $v_j$, and $w$ such that
    \begin{compactenum}[(a)]
      \item $v_0\in B(H)$ and $\deg^+_H(v_0)=2$;
      \item $w\in B(H-v_0)$ and $\deg^+_{H-v_0}(w)\ge 3$; and
      \item $v_j\in B(H)$ and $N^+_H(v_j) \subseteq N_H[w] $.
    \end{compactenum}
    \label[p]{two_three_pair}
  \end{compactenum}
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
  We will assume that $H$ does not satisfy \cref{two_critical} or \cref{degree_three} and show that $H$ must satisfy \cref{two_three_pair}.  Since $H-B(H)$ is not critical, $B(H-B(H))$ contains a vertex $w$ with $\deg_{H-B(H)}(w)\ge 2$.

  Let $C$ be the biconnected component of $H$ that contains $w$, so $C$ is a near-triangulation.  Therefore, we can apply \cref{degree_2_outer_neighbour} to $C$ and $w$. Each of the first two alternatives in \cref{degree_2_outer_neighbour} are incompatible with the assumption that $\deg^+_{H-B(H)}(w)\ge 2$.  Therefore, we conclude that $N_H(w)\cap B(H)$ contains a vertex $v_0$ with $\deg^+_H(v_0)\ge 2$.  Since $H$ does not satisfy \cref{degree_three}, $\deg^+_H(v_0)< 3$, so $\deg^+_H(v_0)=2$.

  \end{figure}

  Let $v_0,\ldots,v_{k-1}$ be the cycle that bounds the inner face $f$ of $H[B(H)]$ that contains $w$ in its interior.  Since $H$ is a near-triangulation, $H$ contains triangles $v_0v_1x$ and $v_{k-1}v_0 y$ with $x$ and $y$ in the interior of or on the boundary of $f$.  Since $f$ is a face of $H[B(H)]$ each of $x$ and $y$ is in the interior of $f$.  At least one of $x$ or $y$ is equal to $w$, say $x$, since otherwise $\deg^+_H(v_0)\ge 3$.  Therefore $v_0v_1 w$ is an inner face of $H$.  Let $j\ge 1$ be the maximum integer such that $v_{a-1}v_{a}w$ is an inner face of $H$ for all $a\in\{1,\ldots,j\}$.  Note that $j<\ell-1$ since, otherwise, the component of $H-B(H)$ that contains $w$ contains only a single vertex, contradicting the fact that $\deg^+_{H-B(H)}(w)=2$.

  Since $H$ is a near-triangulation and $f$ is a face of $H[B(H)]$, $H$ has some face $v_j v_{j+1} z$ with $z$ in the interior of $f$.  By the definition of $j$, $z\neq w$.  Therefore, $N_H^+(v_j)\supseteq \{w,z\}$ and, since $\deg^+_H(v_j)\le 2$, $N_H^+(v_j))= \{w,z\}$.  Therefore $N^+_H(v_j)\subseteq N_H[w]$.  Since $f$ is a face of $H[B(H)]$, the only neighbours of $v_j$ in $B(H)$ are $v_{j-1}$ and $v_{j+1}$. Since $H$ is a near-triangulation, this implies that $w v_j z$ is a face of $H$.  In particular $wz$ is an edge of $H$.

  All that remains is to show that $\deg^+_{H-v_0}(w)\ge 3$.  First, observe that $z$ is in $B(H-B(H))$, so $z$ does not contribute to $\deg^+_{H-B(H)}(w)$. We claim that $z$ is in $I(H-v_0)$, so $z$ does contribute to $\deg^+_{H-v_0}(w)$.   Indeed, the only other possibility is that $z$ is adjacent to $v_0$.  In this case, consider the cycle $C:=v_0,\ldots,v_j,z$.  This cycle has $w$ in its interior. The vertices of $N^+_{H-B(H)}(w)$ must be in the interior of $C$. For each $a\in\{1,\ldots,j\}$, $v_{a-1}v_a w$ is a face of $H$, so the cycle $D:=v_0,\ldots,v_j,w$ does not contain any vertices of $N^+_{H-B(H)}(w)$ in its interior.  Therefore, the vertices in $N^+_{H-B(H)}(w)$ must be in the interior of the cycle $\overline{D}:=v_0,w,z$.  Since $H$ is a near-triangulation, this implies that at least one of $v_0$ is adjacent to some vertex in $I(H)\setminus\{w,z\}$. But this is not possible since it would imply that $\deg^+_H(v_0)\ge 3$.  Therefore $v_0$ is not adjacent to $z$, so $z$ is in the interior of $H-v_0$ and $N^+_{H-v_0}(w)\supseteq N^+_{H-B(H)}(w)\uplus\{z\}$, so $\deg^+_H(w)\ge 3$.
\end{proof}


\subsection{$2$-Critical Graphs}

We say that a generalized near-triangulation $H$ is \defin{$2$-critical} if $H-B(H)$ is critical and $\deg^+_H(v)\le 2$ for each $v\in B(H)$. (See \cref{two_critical_figure}.)  Observe that any critical graph is also $2$-critical.  We will work our way up to a proof of the following lemma, which allows our algorithm to handle $2$-critical graphs directly, in one step:

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[page=3,trim={0 15 0 0},clip]{figs/bg_layers}
  \caption{A $2$-critical generalized near-triangulation.}
  \label{two_critical_figure}
\end{figure}

\begin{lem}\label{two_critical_handler}
  Let $H$ be a $2$-critical generalized near-triangulation.  Then there exists $X\subseteq V(H)$ of size at most $|H|/3$ that dominates $I(H)$ and such that each component of $H[X]$ contains at least one vertex in $B(H)$.
\end{lem}



%
% For any graph $H$ and two subsets $A$ and $B$ of vertices of $H$, we use $E_H(A,B):=\{vw\in E(H):v\in A, w\in B\}$ to denote the set of edges of $H$ with one endpoint in $A$ and one endpoint in $B$.


% \begin{obs}\label{degree_isolated}
%   Let $H$ be a generalized near-triangulation and let $C$ be a component of $H-B(H)$ that consists of a single vertex. Then $|E_H(V(C),B(H))|\ge 3$.
% \end{obs}
%
% \begin{proof}
%   The single vertex $w$ in $C$ is an inner vertex of the generalized near-triangulation $H$, $\deg_H(w)\ge 3$.  Since $\deg_{H-B(H)}(w)=0$, every edge incident to $w$ has an endpoint in $B(H)$, so $|E_H(V(C),B(H))|=\deg_H(w)\ge 3$.
% \end{proof}
%

% \begin{obs}\label{degree_minimum}
%   Let $H$ be a generalized near-triangulation and let $C$ be a component of $H-B(H)$. Then $|E_H(V(C),B(H))|\ge 3$.
% \end{obs}
%
% \begin{proof}
%   By contracting all the vertices of $C$ into a single vertex $w$ and eliminating multiple edges, we obtain a generalized near-triangulation $H'$ in which $w$ is an isolated vertex in $H'-B(H')=H'-B(H)$.  By \cref{degree_isolated}, $|E_{H'}(\{w\},B(H))|\ge 3$.  For every edge $wv\in E_{H'}(\{w\},B(H))$, there is at least one edge $w'v\in E_H(V(C),B(H))$, so $|E_H(V(C),B(H))|\ge |E_{H'}(\{w\},B(H))|\ge 3$.
% \end{proof}


% \begin{obs}\label{degree_minimum}
%   Let $H$ be a generalized near-triangulation and let $C$ be a component of $H-B(H)$. Then $|E_H(V(C),B(H))|\ge 3$.
% \end{obs}




For a graph $H$ and a subset $A$ of the vertices of $H$, $\widehat{N}_{H}(A):=\{v\in N_H(A):|N_H(v)\cap A|\ge 2\}$. We will abuse this notation slightly by using the shorthand $\widehat{N}_H(C):=\widehat{N}_H(V(C))$ when $C$ is a subgraph of $H$. (See \cref{n2}.)
\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[page=3]{figs/n2}
  \caption{An illustration of $\widehat{N}_H(A)$. Vertices of $A$ are black, vertices in $\widehat{N}_H(A)$ are orange and vertices in $N_H(A)\setminus \widehat{N}_H(A)$ are in grey.}
  \label{n2}
\end{figure}
% Let $H$ be a $2$-critical graph and let $C$ be a component of $H-B(H)$. We say that a vertex $v$ in $B(H)$ \defin{belongs} to $C$ if $|N_H(v)\cap V(C)|= 2$.  Note that, since $H$ is $2$-critical any $v\in B(H)$ belongs to at most once component of $H-B(H)$. We use the notation $S_H(C)$ to denote the set of all vertices in $B(H)$ that belong to $C$.
A \defin{corner} of a face $f$ in a plane graph $H$ is an ordered pair $(uv,vw)$ of (directed) edges in $H$ that occur consecutively around $v$ and such that the face $f$ is to the left of the path $uvw$.  Note that this includes the possibility that $u=w$, which occurs when $v$ has degree $1$. The vertex $v$ is the \defin{internal vertex} of the corner $(uv,vw)$.  For a plane graph $H$, $\corners(H)$ denotes the set of corners on the outer face of $H$.

\begin{lem}\label{corner_degree}
  Let $H$ be a $2$-critical generalized near-triangulation, and let $C$ be a component of $H-B(H)$ with at least two vertices. Then $|\widehat{N}_H(C)|\ge |\corners(C)|$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
  Consider some corner $(uv, vw)$ of the outer face of $C$.  Since $u,v,w$ are in $I(H)$, $H$ contains faces $uxv$ and $vyw$ that are to the left of $uv$ and $vw$, respectively. Since the path $uvw$ is on the outer face of $C$, these faces are not faces of $H-B(H)$, so $x,y\in B(H)$.  Since $x$ is adjacent to $u$ and $v$ and $y$ is adjacent to $v$ and $w$, each of $x$ and $y$ is in $\widehat{N}_H(C)$.  We claim that $x\neq y$.  To see this, there are two cases to consider. (See \cref{uvw}.)
  \begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{cc}
      \includegraphics[page=1]{figs/corners} &
      \includegraphics[page=2]{figs/corners}
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{The two cases in the  proof of \cref{corner_degree}.}
    \label{uvw}
  \end{figure}
  \begin{compactenum}
    \item If $u\neq w$ and $x=y$ then $x\in B(H)$ is adjacent to each of $u,v,w\in I(H)$, so $\deg^+_H(x)\ge 3$, contradicting the fact that $H$ is $2$-critical.
    \item If $u=w$ and $x=y$, then there are two distinct inner faces of $H$ (one on each side of $ux$) that each have $u$, $v$, and $w$ on their boundary, which is not possible because $H$ does not have parallel edges.
  \end{compactenum}
  Therefore, the edges $vx$ and $vy$ can be assigned to the corner $(uv,vw)$. By doing this for each corner of the outer face of $C$ we obtain a mapping from the edges between $\widehat{N}_H(C)$ and $B(C)$ onto $\corners(C)$ in which each corner has two edges mapped onto it.  Therefore, the number of edges between $\widehat{N}_H(C)$ and $B(C)$ is at least $2|\corners{C}|$.  By definition, each vertex in $\widehat{N}_H(C)$ has two neighbours in $C$, so $|\widehat{N}_H(C)|\ge |\corners(C)|$.
\end{proof}

A \defin{star} is a tree with one vertex of degree at least $2$ and all other vertices of degree $1$.
For a graph $H$ and a non-negative integer $d$, let $V_d(H):=\{v\in V(H):\deg_H(v)=d\}$ be the set of vertices of $H$ having degree $d$.

\begin{lem}\label{degree_corners_and_leaves}
  Let $H$ be a $2$-critical generalized near-triangulation and let $C$ be a component of $H-B(H)$ with at least two vertices. Then $|\widehat{N}_H(C)|\ge |B(C)|$.  Furthermore, if $C$ has at least three vertices and is not a star then $|\widehat{N}_H(C)|\ge |B(C)| + |V_1(C)|$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
  Each vertex in $B(C)$ is the internal vertex of at least one corner in $\corners(C)$ so, by \cref{corner_degree}, $|E_H(V(C),B(H))|\ge 2|B(C)|$.  This establishes the first part of the corollary.

  Now suppose $|C|\ge 3$ and $C$ is not a star and consider some vertex $v\in V(C)$ that is adjacent to $d\ge 1$ vertices $v_1,\ldots,v_d$ in $V_1(C)$.  Since $C$ is not a star, $v$ is also adjacent to at least one vertex $w$ in $B(C)\setminus V_1(C)$. We claim that $v$ is the internal vertex of at least $d+1$ corners in $\corners(C)$. Indeed, for each $i\in\{1,\ldots,d\}$ $v$ is the internal vertex of the corners $(x_iv,vv_i)$ and $(v_iv,vy_i)$ for some $x_i,y_i\in B(C)$.  There is at least one value of $i$ for which $x_i\not\in\{v_1,\ldots,v_d\}$.
  % and at least one value of $i$ for which $y_1\not\in\{v_1,\ldots,v_d\}$.
  For each $i\in\{1,\ldots,d\}$, there is at most one value $j$ such that $(x_iv,vv_i)=(v_jv,vy_j)$ and there is at least one value $i\in\{1,\ldots,d\}$ for which no such $j$ exists.  Therefore
  $
  |\bigcup_{i=1}^d \{(x_iv,vv_i),(v_iv,vy_i)\}| > d.
  $
  If we let $A$ denote the subset of vertices in $B(C)$ that are adjacent to at least one vertex in $V_1(C)$ we see that
  \[
    |\corners(C)| \ge |B(C)\setminus A| + |A| + |V_1(C)|
    = |B(C)| + |V_1(C)|  \enspace .
  \]
  Now the second part of the lemma follows from \cref{corner_degree}.
\end{proof}

% \begin{lem}\label{boundary_size}
%   Let $H$ be a $2$-critical generalized near-triangulation.  Then $|B(H)|\ge\mu(H-B(H))$.
% \end{lem}
%
% \begin{proof}
%
%   Follows immediately from \cref{degree_isolated,degree_walk} and the fact that $\deg^+_H(v)\le 2$ for all $v\in B(H)$.
% \end{proof}

For each integer $r\ge 3$, the \defin{$r$-wheel} $W_r$ is the near-triangulation whose outer face is bounded by a cycle $v_0,\ldots,v_{r-1}$ that contains a single vertex $x$ in its interior and that is adjacent to each of $v_0,\ldots,v_{r-1}$.

Note that the following lemma is about critical graphs, not $2$-critical graphs.

\begin{lem}\label{biconnected_critical}
  Let $H$ be a biconnected critical generalized near-triangulation with at least $3$ vertices and not isomorphic to $W_k$ for any even integer $k$.  Then there exists a partition $\{X_0,X_1,X_2\}$ of $V(H)$ such that
  \begin{compactenum}[(i)]
    \item For each edge $vw$ of $H[B(H)]$, $v\in X_i$ and $w\in X_j$ for some $i\neq j$;\label[p]{proper}
    \item for each $i\in\{0,1,2\}$, $X_i$ dominates $H$. \label[p]{dominates_h}
  \end{compactenum}
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
  If $H$ is isomorphic to $W_k$ for some odd integer $k\ge 3$, then we take $X_0:=\{v_0, x\}$, $X_1:=\{v_{2i-1}:i\in\{1,\ldots,\lfloor k/2\rfloor\}$, and $X_2:=\{v_{2i}:i\in\{1,\ldots,\lfloor k/2\rfloor\}$.  It is straightforward to verify that these sets satisfy \cref{proper,dominates_h}.  (The fact that $k$ is odd ensures that $v_0$ has a neighbour $v_1\in X_1$ and $v_{k-1}\in X_2$, which ensures \cref{dominates_h}---this is not true for even $k$.)   We now assume that $H$ is not isomorphic to $W_k$ for any integer $k$.  By \cref{critical_structure}, this implies that $H$ is outerplanar or that $H[B(H)]$ has at least two inner faces.

  We now proceed by induction on $|I(H)|$.  If $|I(H)|=0$ then $H$ is an edge-maximal outerplanar graph, and therefore has a proper $3$-colouring.  We take $X_0$, $X_1$, and $X_2$ to be the three colour classes in this colouring.  This choice clearly satisfies \cref{proper}. Since each vertex of $H$ is included in at least one triangle, each vertex of $H$ is dominated by each of $X_0$, $X_1$, and $X_2$, so this choice satisfies \cref{dominates_h}.

    \end{tabular}
    \caption{The proof of \cref{biconnected_critical}}
    \label{contraction_proof}
  \end{figure}
  If $|I(H)|\ge 1$ then $H$ is not outerplanar.  See \cref{contraction_proof}.  Since $H$ is not isomorphic to $W_k$ for any integer $k$, $H[B(H)]$ contains at least two inner faces.  Let $x$ be an inner vertex of $H$ and let $f$ be the marked face of $H[B(H)]$ that contains $x$.
  % If $f$ has only three vertices, then we apply induction on $H':=H-x$ to obtain sets $X_0'$, $X_1'$, and $X_2'$.  We then set $X_0:=X_0'\cup\{x\}$, $X_1:=X_1'$ and $X_2:=X_2'$.  These sets satisfy \cref{proper} because every edge of $H[B(H)]$ is also an edge of $H'[B(H')]$.  These sets satisfy \cref{colourful} because $f$ is a clique of size $3$ in $H'$ so, by \cref{proper}, each $X_i$ contains at least one vertex of $f$. Now, \cref{colourful} also implies that each $X_i$ dominates $x$ and (by induction) dominates $V(H)\setminus\{x\}$, so each $X_i$ is a dominating set.
  Since $H[B(H)]$ has at least two inner faces and $H$ is biconnected, $f$ contains an edge $vw$ that is on the boundary of two faces of $H$.  Let $H'$ be the graph obtained by contracting the edge $vx$ into $v$. Then $H'[B(H')]=H[B(H)]$ and $H'$ is a biconnected critical generalized near-triangulation so we apply induction to obtain sets $X_0'$, $X_1'$ and $X_2'$.  Without loss of generality, we can assume that $v$ is in $X_1'$.  Then we set $X_0:=X_0'$, $X_1:=X_1'\cup\{x\}$ and $X_2:=X_2'$. Since $H'[B(H')]=H[B(H)]$ this clearly satisfies \cref{proper}.  Since $H'$ contains the edge $vw$ for each $w\in V(f)\setminus\{v\}$, \cref{proper} implies that the vertices of the path $f-v$ are alternately contained in $X_2$ and $X_0$.
  % In particular, since $f$ has at least three vertices these sets satisfy \cref{colourful}.

  All that remains is to show that $X_0$, $X_1$, and $X_2$ satisfy \cref{dominates_h}.  The inductive hypothesis already implies that each of these sets dominates $V(H)\setminus V(f)$.  Since $x$ is adjacent to every vertex of $f$, it is adjacent to at least one vertex of $X_0$ at least one vertex of $X_2$.  Therefore, each of $X_0$, $X_1$, and $X_2$ dominates $x$.  For each vertex $w\in V(f)\setminus\{v\}$, $w$ is adjacent to $x\in X_1$, $w\in X_{i}$ for some $i\in\{0,2\}$ and $w$ is adjacent a neighbour $w'\in X_{2-i}$ in $f$, so each of these sets dominates $w$.  Finally, since the vertex $v$ is incident to a chord of $H[B(H)]$, it is incident to a second face $f'\neq f$ of $H[B(H)]$.  Since $f$ is marked and $H$ is critical, $f'$ is not marked.  Therefore $f'$ is a triangle with one vertex in each of $X_0$, $X_1$, and $X_2$. Therefore each of these sets dominates $v$.
\end{proof}

The following lemma, illustrated in \cref{even_wheel}
 explains how we deal with even wheels:

\begin{lem}\label{wheelie}
  Let $H:=W_k$ for some even integer $k\ge 4$ and let $v$ be any vertex in $B(H)$.  Then there exists a partition $\{X_0,X_1,X_2\}$ of $V(H)$ such that
  \begin{compactenum}[(i)]
    \item For each edge $vw$ of $H[B(H)]$, $v\in X_i$ and $w\in X_j$ for some $i\neq j$;\label[p]{proper2}
    % \item For each inner face $f$ of $H[B(H)]$ and each $i\in\{0,1,2\}$, $V(f)\cap X_i\neq\emptyset$; and \label[p]{colourful}
    % that contains $x_f\in I(H)$ in its interior, exactly one vertex $v_f$ of $f$ is in the set $X_i$ that contains $x$ and $v_f$ is incident to a chord of $H[B(H)]$. \pat{Define chord.}
    \item $X_0$ dominates $V(H)\setminus\{v\}$ and $X_1$ and $X_2$ each dominate $H$. \label[p]{weak_dominates_h}
  \end{compactenum}
\end{lem}

  \caption{Partitioning the vertices of an even wheel into sets $X_0$, $X_1$, and $X_2$.}
  \label{even_wheel}
\end{figure}
\begin{proof}
  Label the vertices of $W_k$ as $v_0,\ldots,v_{k-1}$ so that $v=v_0$.  Then the sets $X_1:=\{v_0, x\}$, $X_2:=\{v_{2i-1}:i\in\{1,\ldots,k/2\}\}$, and $X_0:=\{v_{2i}:i\in\{1,\ldots, k/2-1\}\}$ satisfy the requirements of the lemma.
\end{proof}


Now we drop the requirement that $H$ is biconnected.


\begin{lem}\label{critical}
  Let $H$ be a connected critical generalized near-triangulation with at least $3$ vertices and not isomorphic to $W_k$ for any even integer $k$ and let $L:=V_1(H)$.  Then there exists a partition $\{X_0,X_1,X_2\}$ of $V(H)$ and partition $\{L_0,L_1,L_2\}$ of $L$ such that
  \begin{compactenum}[(i)]
    \item for each edge $vw$ of $H[B(H)]$, $v\in X_i$ and $w\in X_j$ for some $i\neq j$;\label[p]{proper_2}
    % \item for each marked face $f$ of $H[B(H)]$ and each $i\in\{0,1,2\}$, $V(f)\cap X_i\neq\emptyset$; and \label[p]{colourful_2}
    % that contains $x_f\in I(H)$ in its interior, exactly one vertex $v_f$ of $f$ is in the set $X_i$ that contains $x$ and $v_f$ is incident to a chord of $H[B(H)]$. \pat{Define chord.}
    \item for each $i\in\{0,1,2\}$, $X_i$ dominates $V(H)\setminus L_i$,  \label[p]{dominates_h_minus_l}
  \end{compactenum}
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
  The proof is by induction on $|H|$.  If $|H|=3$ then $H$ is either a triangle $v_0,v_1,v_2$ or a path $v_0,v_1,v_2$.  In either case, we take $X_i:=\{v_i\}$ for each $i\in\{0,1,2\}$.  If $H$ is a triangle, then $L=\emptyset$ and we take $L_0:=L_1:=L_2:=\emptyset$.  If $H$ is a path then $L=\{v_0,v_2\}$ and we take $L_0:=\{v_2\}$, $L_1:=\emptyset$ and $L_2:=\{v_0\}$.  It is straightforward to verify these sets satisfy the requirements of the lemma.

  If $L\neq\emptyset$ then let $z$ be a vertex in $L$ and let $z_r,\ldots,z_0$ the maximal path in $H$ such that $z=z_r$ and each of $z_1,\ldots,z_{r-1}$ has degree $2$ in $H$. Consider the graph $H':=H-\{z_1,\ldots,z_{r}\}$.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item If $z_0\in L$, then $H'$ is the graph that contains only $z_0$ and $H=z_r,\ldots,z_0$ is a path.  In this case $L:=\{z_0,z_r\}$. We take $X_i:=\{z_j:j\equiv i\pmod 3\}$ for each $i\in\{0,1,2\}$, $L_2=\{z_0\}$.  Starting with $L_0:=L_1:=\emptyset$ and $L_2:=\{z_0\}$, we then set
    $L_{(r-2)\bmod 3}\gets L_{(r-2)\bmod 3} \cup \{z_r\}$.  This produces sets that satisfy the requirements of the lemma, and we are done.

    \item If $H'$ is isomorphic to $W_k$ for some even integer $k$ then we apply \cref{wheelie} with $v=z_0$ to obtain sets $X_0'$, $X_1'$, $X_2'$, $L_0'$, $L_1'$, and $L_2'$.

    \item Otherwise, we apply the inductive hypothesis on $H'$ to obtain sets $X_0'$, $X_1'$, $X_2'$, $L_0'$, $L_1'$, and $L_2'$.
  \end{enumerate}
  \begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{figs/tail}
    \caption{Dealing with a degree-$1$ vertex, $z_r$, in the proof of \cref{critical}.}
    \label{critical_degree_one}
  \end{figure}
  See \cref{critical_degree_one}.
  In the latter two cases, we may assume, without loss of generality (by renaming colours), that $z_0\in X_{1}'$.  Since $z_0\not\in L$, $\deg_H(z_0)\ge 3$ so $\deg_{H'}(z_0)\ge 2$.  Therefore we may assume, without loss of generality, that $X_1'$ and $X_2'$ each dominate $z_0$. Redefine $L_{(2-r)\bmod 3}'\gets L_{(2-r)\bmod 3}'\cup\{z_r\}$ so that $L_0'$, $L_1'$ and $L_2'$ is a partitition of $L$.  Then we take $X_i:=X_{i}'\cup\{z_j:1-j\equiv i\pmod 3\}$, $L_0:=L_0'$, $L_1:= L_1'$, and $L_2:=L_2'$.  These sets satisfy the requirements of the lemma.  Indeed, the only concern would be that $z_0$ is not dominated by $X_0$ because $z_0$ is not necessarily dominated by $X_0'$, but this does not occur because $X_0$ includes $z_1$.

  Finally, we arrive at the case in which $L=\emptyset$. If $H$ is biconnected then, since $H$ is not a wheel, we can immediately apply \cref{biconnected_critical} and we are done.  Otherwise, $H$ contains a cut vertex $v$ that separates $H$ into components $C_1,\ldots,C_k$ and such that $H':=H[V(C_1)\cup\{v\}]$ is biconnected. Since $L=\emptyset$, $H'$ has at least three vertices. If $H'$ is isomorphic to $W_k$ for some even integer $k$ then we apply \cref{wheelie} to $H'$ and $v$ to obtain sets $X_0'$, $X_1'$, $X_2'$, $L_0'=\emptyset$, $L_1'=\emptyset$, and $L_2'=\emptyset$. Otherwise, we apply \cref{biconnected_critical} to $H'$ to obtain sets $X_0'$, $X_1'$, $X_2'$, $L_0'=\emptyset$, $L_1'=\emptyset$, and $L_2'=\emptyset$.  In either case we may assume, without loss of generality that $v\in X_1'$, that $X_1'$ and $X_2'$ each dominate $H'$ and that $X_0'$ dominates $V(H')\setminus\{v\}$.

  Let $H'':=H-V(C_1)$. If $H''$ is isomorphic to $W_k$ for some even integer $k$ then we apply \cref{wheelie} to $H''$ and $v$ to obtain sets $X_0''$, $X_1''$, $X_2''$, $L_0''=\emptyset$, $L_1''=\emptyset$, and $L_2''=\emptyset$. Otherwise, we apply the inductive hypothesis to $H''$ to obtain sets $X_0''$, $X_1''$, $X_2''$ that each dominate $H''$. In either case we may assume, without loss of generality (by renaming) that $v\in X_1''$, that $X_1''$ and $X_2''$ each dominate $H'$ and that $X_0''$ dominates $V(H'')\setminus\{v\}$.  Then the sets $X_0:=X_0'\cup X_2''$, $X_1:=X_1'\cup X_1''$ and $X_2:=X_2'\cup X_0''$ satisfy the requirements of the lemma.  (Again, the only concern is whether each set dominates $v$, but this is guaranteed by the fact that $v\in X_1$, and that $X_2'\subseteq X_2$ and $X_2''\subseteq X_0$ each dominate $v$.)
\end{proof}


\begin{lem}\label{three_sets_coverage}
  Let $H$ be a $2$-critical generalized near-triangulation.  Then there exists $X_0,X_1,X_2\subseteq V(H)$ such that
  \begin{compactenum}[(i)]
    \item $|X_0|+|X_1|+|X_2| \le |H|$; \label[p]{total_size}
    \pat{Bouding just in terms of $|H|$ is not enough.  We need a bound of at most $2|B(H-B(H))| + |I(H-B(H))|$.}
    \item for each $i\in\{0,1,2\}$, $X_i$ dominates $I(H)$ in $H$; and \label[p]{dominates_i}
    \item for each $i\in\{0,1,2\}$, each component of $H[X_i]$ contains at least one vertex in $B(H)$. \label[p]{connectivity}
  \end{compactenum}
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
  Refer to \cref{covers}.
  Let $H_1:=H-B(H)$, let $\mathcal{C}_1$ be the set of components of $H_1$ having exactly one vertex, let $\mathcal{C}_2$ be the set of components of $H_1$ having exactly two vertices, let $\mathcal{C}_\star$ be the set of components of $H_1$ that are stars, let $\mathcal{C}_{\boxtimes}$ be the set of components of $H_1$ that are even wheels, and let $\overline{\mathcal{C}}$ be the set of componets of $H_1$ that are not in $\mathcal{C}_1\cup \mathcal{C}_2\cup \mathcal{C}_{\star}\cup \mathcal{C}_{\boxplus}$.

    \label{covers}
  \end{figure}

  % By \cref{boundary_vs_leaves}, to satisfy \cref{boundary_size} it suffices to construct three sets whose total size is not more than $|I_1|+\mu(H_1)=|I_1|+2|Z| + |L| + |B_1|$.

  For each component $C$ in $\mathcal{C}_2$ we choose one vertex $v$ in $B(H)$ that dominates $V(C)$ and place $v$ in each of $X_0$, $X_1$, and $X_2$. This contributes a total of $3|\mathcal{C}_2|$ vertices in $X_0$, $X_1$, and $X_2$. On the other hand, $\sum_{C\in \mathcal{C}_2} |C|=2|\mathcal{C}_2|$ and, by \cref{degree_corners_and_leaves},  $\sum_{C\in \mathcal{C}_2} |\widehat{N}_H(C)|\ge 2|\mathcal{C}_2|$.

  For each component $C$ in $\mathcal{C}_{\star}$ we choose the vertex $w\in C$ that dominates the star $C$ and a vertex $v\in B(H)$ adjacent to $w$.  We place $\{v,w\}$ in each of $X_0$, $X_1$, and $X_2$.  This contributes a total of $6|\mathcal{C}_{\star}|$ vertices to $X_0$, $X_1$, and $X_2$.  On the other hand, $\sum_{C\in \mathcal{C}_{\star}} |C|\ge 3|\mathcal{C}_{\star}|$ and, by \cref{degree_corners_and_leaves}, $\sum_{C\in \mathcal{C}_{\star}} |\widehat{N}_H(C)|\ge 3|\mathcal{C}_\star|$. \pat{Remark: this inequality is always loose, in fact $|\widehat{N}_H(C)|\ge 4|C|$}

  For each component $C$ in $\mathcal{C}_{\boxtimes}$ we choose the vertex $x$ that dominates $C$, some vertex $w$ in $B(C)$ and some vertex $v\in B(H)$ adjacent to $w$.  We place $\{v,w,x\}$ in each of $X_0$, $X_1$, and $X_2$.  This contributes a total of $9|\mathcal{C}_{\boxplus}|$ vertices to $X_0$, $X_1$, and $X_2$. On the other hand, $\sum_{C\in \mathcal{C}_{\boxplus}} |C|\ge 5|\mathcal{C}_{\star}|$ and, by \cref{degree_corners_and_leaves}, $\sum_{C\in \mathcal{C}_{\star}} |\widehat{N}_H(C)|\ge 4|\mathcal{C}_{\boxtimes}|$.

  For each component $C$ in $\overline{\mathcal{C}}$, we apply \cref{biconnected_critical} to obtain sets $X_0'$, $X_1'$, $X_2'$, $L_0'$, $L_1'$, and $L_2'$.
  For each $j\in\{0,1,2\}$ we add $X_j'$ to $X_j$ and for each $w\in L_j'$ we choose a neighbour $w'$ of $w$ in $B(H)$ and add it to $X_j$.  This ensures that $X_j$ dominates every vertex in $C$.  The total number of vertices added to $X_0$, $X_1$, and $X_2$ by this step is $\sum_{C\in\overline{\mathcal{C}}}(|C|+|B(C)|+|V_1(C)|)$.  On the other hand, by \cref{degree_corners_and_leaves}, $\sum_{C\in \overline{\mathcal{C}}} |\widehat{N}_H(C)|\ge \sum_{C\in \overline{\mathcal{C}}} (|B(C)|+|V_1(C)|)$.

  Finally, it remains to consider the components of $H_1$ that are in $\mathcal{C}_1$. Each of these components is a single vertex in $V_0(H_1)$. These we deal with as a group. For each $w\in V_0(H_1)$, let $H_w:=H[N_H[w]]$ and let $Q:=\bigcup_{w\in V_0(H_1)} H_w$.  For each $w\in V_0(V_1)$, the graph $H_w$ is isomorphic to $W_k$ for some $k\ge 3$, $B(H_w)\subseteq B(H)$ and, for any component $C$ of $H_1$ other than the one containing $w$, $\widehat{N}_H(C)\cap B(H_w)=\emptyset$. In other words, none of the vertices in $B(Q)$ has been counted in the preceding paragraphs.  We construct a $X'\subseteq B(Q)\subseteq B(H)$ that dominates $I(Q)=V_0(V_1)$ by repeating the following as long as there is vertex $w$ in $V_0(H_1)$ not dominated by $X'$:
  \begin{compactenum}
    \item  If $H_w$ has no vertex in common with $H_{w'}$ for any $w'\in V_0(H_1)\setminus\{w\}$ then we add any vertex of $B(H_w)$ to $X'$.
    \item Otherwise there exists $w'\neq w$ and $v\in B(H_w)\cap B(H_{w'})$ and we add $v$ to $Z'$.
  \end{compactenum}
  In the first case, the (at least four) vertices of $H_w$ are no longer relevant and can be removed from $Q$. In the second case, the vertices $v$, $w$, and $w'$ are no longer relevant and can be removed from $Q$. Thus, at each step we add one vertex to $X'$ and eliminate at least three vertices from $Q$.  Therefore $|X'|\le |Q|/3$.  We finish by adding $X'$ to each of $X_1$, $X_2$, and $X_3$.
  Putting everything together we get that
  \[
   |X_1|+|X_2|+|X_3| \le \sum_{C\in\mathcal{C}} (|C|+\widehat{N}_H(C)) + |Q|
   \le \sum_{C\in\mathcal{C}} |C| + B(H) = I(H)+B(H)=|H| \enspace . \qedhere
  \]
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof of \cref{two_critical_handler}]
  Take $X$ to be the smallest of the three sets $X_0$, $X_1$, and $X_2$ guaranteed by \cref{three_sets_coverage}.
\end{proof}


\subsection{The Algorithm}

All of this has been leading up to a variant  $\textsc{SimpleGreedy}(G)$ that we call $\textsc{BetterGreedy}(G)$.  Suppose we have already chosen $\Delta_0,\ldots,\Delta_{i-1}$ for some $i\ge 0$ and we now want to choose $\Delta_i$.  Let $X_i:=\bigcup_{j=0}^{i-1}\Delta_j$, let $G_i$ be a dom-preserving subgraph of $G-X_i$ that is dom-minimal, and let $v_i$ be a vertex in $B(G_i)$ that maximizes $\deg^+_{G_i}(v_i)$.  During iteration $i\ge 0$, there are now three cases to consider:
\begin{compactenum}[{[}bg1{]}]
    \item If $\deg^+_{G_i}(v_i)\ge 3$ then we set $\Delta_i\gets\{v_i\}$.
    \label[bg]{bg_high_degree}
    \item If there exists distinct $u,v\in B(G_i)$ and $w\in B(G_i-B(G_i))$ such that $\deg^+_{G_i}(v)=2$, $\deg^+_{G_i-v}(w)\ge 3$, and $N^+_{G_i}(u)\subseteq N_{G_i}(w)$ then set $\Delta_i:=\{v,w\}$.
    \label[bg]{bg_two_three}
    \item Otherwise, $G_i$ is $2$-critical and $i+1=r$.  By \cref{two_critical_handler}, there exists $\Delta_{r-1}\subseteq V(G_i)$ of size at most $|B(G_i-B(G_i))|/3 + |I(G_i[I(G_i)])|$ that dominates $I(G_i)$.
    \label[bg]{bg_two_critical}
\end{compactenum}

\begin{thm}\label{best_greedy}
  When applied to an $n$-vertex triangulation $G$,  $\textsc{BetterGreedy}(G)$ produces a connected dominating set $X_r$ of size at most $10n/21\pm O(1)$.
\end{thm}
% \hussein{Is adding the following inequality to the constrains helpful  $r \leq |E|/4 \leq 3n/4 - 3/2$? I don t think so  } \pat{No: The optimal is achieve when $r\approx n/7$}
\begin{proof}
  For each integer $t\ge 3$, let $x_t$ be the number of times $\textsc{BetterGreedy}(G)$ falls into case \cref{bg_high_degree} and chooses $v_i$ such that $\deg^+_{G_i}(v_i)=t$ and let $z$ be the number of times $\textsc{BetterGreedy}(G)$ falls into case \cref{bg_two_three}.  Then
  \[
     D:=\left|N_G[X_{r-1}]\right| = 3 + \sum_{t\ge 3}tx_t + 5z \enspace .
  \]
  is the size of the set dominated $X_{r-1}$ immediately before the final iteration of $\textsc{BetterGreedy}(G)$.

  Let $Q:=|B(G_{r-1})|$, let $R:=|B(G_{r-1}-B(G_{r-1}))|$, and let $S:=|I(G_{r-1}-B(G_{r-1}))$.  In words: $Q$ is the size of the boundary of the $2$-critical graph $G_{r-1}$; $R$ is the size of the of the boundary of the critical graph obtained after removing the boundary of $G_{r-1}$; and $S$ is the independent set of vertices in the interior of this critical graph.
  Then, by \cref{degree_corners_and_leaves} and \cref{base_case}

  \begin{equation}
    Q \ge R \ge 3S \enspace . \label{best2}
  \end{equation}
  By definition $r-1 = \sum_{t\ge 3}x_t+z$.
  As in the proofs of \cref{simple_greedy}, $D+|I(G_i)|=D+R+S=n$, so we get the constraint:
  \begin{equation}
    n = D+R+S = \sum_{t\ge 3} tx_t + 5z + R + S \label{best3} \enspace .
  \end{equation}
  Since $B(G_{r-1})\subseteq N_G(X_{r-1})$, $D \ge |X_{r-1}|+|B(G_{r-1})|=r-1+Q$, so
  \begin{equation}
    n = D+R+S \ge r-1 + Q + R + S \enspace . \label{best4}
  \end{equation}
  Finally, the size $Q$ of the boundary $B(G_{r-1})$ is at most
  \begin{equation}
    Q \le 3 + \sum_{t\ge 3}(t-1)x_t + 2z \enspace . \label{best5}
  \end{equation}
  By \cref{two_critical_handler}, the size of $\Delta_{r-1}$ is at most $2(R+S)/3$, so the total size of the final set $X$ is at most
  \begin{equation}
    r-1 + z + (Q+R+S)2(R + S)/3 \enspace .  \label{best_objective}
  \end{equation}
  We can eliminate the variables $x_t$ for $t\ge 4$:
  \begin{clm}
    In any assignment of non-negative values to $Q, R, S$, $z$, and $x_3,x_4\ldots$ that maximizes \cref{best_objective} subject to \cref{best2,best3,best4,best5}, $x_t=0$ for all $t\ge 4$.
  \end{clm}
  \begin{clmproof}
     If $x_t = c >0$ for some $t\ge 3$, then we can set $x_t\gets 0$, $z\gets z+tc/?$, \ldots \pat{Finish this....}
  \end{clmproof}
  \begin{clm}
    In any assignment of non-negative values to $Q, R, S$, $z$, and $x_3,x_4\ldots$ that maximizes \cref{best_objective} subject to \cref{best2,best3,best4,best5}, $z=0$.
  \end{clm}
  \begin{clmproof}
    If $z = c >0$  then we can set $z\gets 0$, $x_3\gets x_3+5c/3$, $Q\gets Q+10c/3-2c=Q+4c/3$, $R\gets 10c/3-2c=Q+4c/3$, and $S\gets 10c/9-2c/3=S+4c/9$. Then the objective function \cref{best_objective} increases by $(5/3+4/3+4/9)c >0$.  \Cref{best2} is still satisfied because the quantities $Q$, $R$, and $3S$ change by exactly the same amount.  \Cref{best3} is still satisfied because the right hand side decreases by $(5-4/3+4/3)c=7c/3$. \Cref{best4} still holds because the right hand side decreases by $4c/3 + 4c/3 +4c/9 - 5c/3>0$  \Cref{best5} still holds because the left hand side decreases by $4c/3$ and the right hand side increases by $10c/3 - 2c=4c/3$.

  \end{clmproof}
  Therefore, \cref{best2,best3,best4,best5} are inequalities in four non-negative variables $x_3$, $Q$, $R$ and $S$.  Maximizing \cref{best_objective} subject to these constraints is an easy linear programming exercise and the maximum is achieved when \pat{Correct these: $x_3=(n-6)/5$, $Q=R=(2n+3)/5$, $S=0$, giving a final bound of $|X|\le r-1+R/3\le (7n-12)/15$---See Sage Code in the appendix.}.

\section{Discussion}

\Cref{two_critical_handler} is the best result we have right now for handling $2$-critical graphs.  This is a shame, because it is known that maximal outerplanar graphs have connected dominating sets of size at most $4n/11$. Unfortunately our critical graphs are not maximal outerplanar---they may not even be connected.  We can end up in a situation where we have a $2$-critical graph that is a collection of disjoint $6$-vertex graphs (a triangle inside a triangle), each of which requires $2$ vetices to dominate.  In this setting $Q=R=3k$ and we need $2k$ vertices in our dominating set, so the analysis is tight.

\hussein{One approach is : why we ended with a graph where all the boundary vertices has $deg^+(v) = 2$? I think before reaching such a graph we had a sequence of vertices $v_i,...,v_j$  such that $\sum_i deg^+(v_i) = |\text{the boundary of the current graph}|$ and $deg^+(v_i) \geq 3$.}

If we wanted to make use of the results for outerplanar graphs, then we would need to be way more careful in the way we choose vertices to delete.  In fact, I don't see any reasonable way to do this without using some variant of the canonical ordering (so that each intermediate graph $G_i$ is a near-triangulation).  Even if we could do that we'll still need something more because the process of making $G_i$ dom-minimal removes useless vertices and edges.

% because we could we reach a step where $G_{r-1}$ is a $2$-critical near-triangulation but $G_{r-1}-B(G_{r-1})$ has many components.  (Think of a serpentine triangulation where one out of every $4$ faces contains three vertices inside it.)

% \section{Moonshot}
%
% We say that a near-triangulation $H$ is \defin{dom-minimal} if
% \begin{compactenum}[({DM}1)]
%     \item each vertex $v\in B(H)$ has $\deg^+_H(v)\ge 1$; \label[dm]{minimum_degree}
%     \item if there exists edges $uv$ and $vw$ on the outer face of $H$ and  $\deg^+_H(v)\ge 1$ then $uw$ is an edge of $H$; and \label[dm]{one_vertex}
%     \item each edge $vw$ on the boundary of the outer face of $H$ is on the boundary an inner face $vxw$ of $H$ for some $x\in I(H)$. \label[dm]{bad_edge}
% \end{compactenum}
% We say that a generalized near-triangulation $H$ is \defin{dom-minimal} if each of its biconnected components are dom-minimal.
%
% \begin{obs}\label{bridgeless}
%     Any dom-minimal generalized near-triangulation $H$ is bridgeless.
% \end{obs}
%
% \begin{proof}
%    If $vw$ is a bridge in $H$ then both $v$ and $w$ are in $B(H)$.  Since $vw$ is a bridge in $H$, there is no path $vxw$ in $H$ and therefore no inner face $vwx$ in $H$. Thus $H$ does not satisfy \cref{bad_edge}.
% \end{proof}
%
% \begin{lem}\label{chord_incident}
%   let $H$ be a (biconnected) dom-minimal non-critical near-triangulation and let $v_0$ be a vertex in $B(H)$ with $|N_H(v_0)\cap B(H)|\ge 3$.  Then $\deg^+_H(v_0)\ge 2$.  In other words, if $v_0$ is incident to a chord of the outerplane graph $H[B(H)]$, then $v_0$ is incident to at least $2$ inner vertices of $H$.
% \end{lem}

%
%   \caption{The proof of \cref{chord_incident}}
%   \label{chord_incident_fig}
% \end{figure}
% \begin{proof}
%   Refer to \cref{chord_incident_fig}
%   Since $H$ is a near-triangulation its outer face is bounded by a cycle $v_0,\ldots,v_{k-1}$.  Let $a:=\min\{i\in\{2,\ldots,k-2\}:v_0v_i\in E(H)\}$ and $b:=\max\{i\in\{2,\ldots,k-2\}:v_0v_i\in E(H)\}$. (Possibly $a=b$, but both $a$ and $b$ are well-defined since $|N^+_H(v_0)|\ge 3$.)   Since $H$ is dom-minimal, the edge $v_0v_1$ is on the boundary of an inner face $v_0v_1x$ of $H$ where $x$ is an inner vertex of $H$.  Since $H$ is dom-minimal, the edge $v_{k-1}v_0$ is on the boundary of an inner face $v_{k-1}v_0y$ of $H$ where $y$ is an inner vertex of $H$.  Then $x$ is in the interior of the face of $H[B(H)]$ bounded by the cycle $v_0,v_1,\ldots,v_a$ and $y$ is in the interior of the face of $H[B(H)]$ bounded by the cycle $v_0,v_b,\ldots,v_{k-1}$.  Therefore, $x\neq y$ and $N^+_H(v_0)\supseteq\{x,y\}$ so $\deg^+_H(v_0)\ge 2$.

% Let $K_5^-$ be the complete graph on five vertices with one edge removed.
%
% \begin{lem}
%   Let $H$ be a near-triangulation with $\deg^+_H(z)\le 2$ for all $z\in B(H)$. If $\deg^+_H(v)=1$ for some $v\in B(H)$, then $H$ is isomorphic to $K_4$ or $K_5^-$.
% \end{lem}
%
% \begin{proof}
%   Since $H$ is dom-minimal each vertex in $B(H)$ has inner-degree at least $1$, by \cref{minimum_degree}.  Therefore the outer face of $H$ is a cycle with at least three vertices.  Let $u$ and $w$ be the two neighbours of $v$ on the outer face.  Since $H$ is dom-minimal, $H$ contains an inner face $vxu$ with $x\in I(H)$, by \cref{bad_edge}.  Since $H$ is dom-minimal, $H$ contains an inner face $wyv$ with $y\in I(H)$.  Since $\deg^+_H(v)=1$, $x=y$.  Since $H$ is dom-minimal $uw$ is an edge of $H$, by \cref{one_vertex}.  Therefore $uvx

% A subgraph $H'$ of a generalized near-triangulation $H$ is \defin{dom-preserving} if
% % every outer-domatic set $X\subseteq V(H')$ of $H'$ is an outer-domatic set of $H$.
%
% \begin{compactenum}[({DP}1)]
%   \item $B(H')\subseteq B(H)$; \label[dp]{smaller_boundary}
%   \item $N^+_{H'}(v)=N^+_H(v)$ for all $v\in B(H')$; \label[dp]{interior_preserving}
%   \item $I(H')=I(H)$; and \label[dp]{inner_neighbourhood_preserving}
%   \item $N_{H'}(v)=N_H(v)\cap V(H')$ for all $v\in I(H)$. \label[dp]{outer_neighbour_preserving}
% \end{compactenum}
%
% \begin{obs}
%   Let $H$ be a generalized near-triangulation, let $H'$ be a dom-preserving subgraph of $H$, and let $\Delta$ be a subset of $V(H')$ that dominates $I(H')$ in $H'$.  Then $\Delta$ dominates $I(H)$ in $H$.
% \end{obs}
%
% % \begin{proof}
% %   Each vertex $v\in I(H')$ is adjacent to some vertex $w\in \Delta$.  Since $N_{H'}(v)=N_H(v)$, $w\in\Delta\cap V(H')$, so $v$ is dominated by $\Delta\cap V(H')$.  Since this is true for each $v\in I(H)=I(H')$, $\Delta\cap V(H')$ dominates $I(H)$.
% % \end{proof}
%
% \begin{lem}\label{dom_minimal}
%   For any generalized near-triangulation $H$, there exists a dom-preserving subgraph $H'$ of $H$ that is dom-minimal.
% \end{lem}
%
% \begin{proof}
%   The proof is by induction on $|V(H)|+|E(H)|$.  If $H$ is already dom-minimal, then setting $H'=H$ satisfies the requirements of the lemma, so assume that $H$ is not dom-minimal.  It is straightforward to verify that the dom-preserving subgraph relationship is transitive, so if $H$ has a dom-preserving subgraph $H^*$ and $H^*$ has a dom-preserving subgraph $H'$ then $H'$ is a dom-preserving subgraph of $H$.  Therefore, it is sufficient to show the existence of a dom-preserving subgraph $H^*$ of $H$ with fewer edges or fewer vertices than $H$. Then the inductive hypothesis provides the desired dom-minimal dom-preserving subgraph $H'$ of $H$.
%
%   If $H$ contains a vertex $v\in B(H)$ with $\deg^+_H(v)=0$ then $H-v$ is a dom-preserving subgraph of $H$ with fewer vertices than $H$.  We now assume that $\deg^+_H(v)\ge 1$ for all $v\in B(H)$.  Since $H$ is not dom-minimal then $H$ contains a biconnected component $C$ that is not dom-minimal.
%   \begin{compactenum}
%     \item If there exists an edge $vw$ on the outer face of $C$ that is not incident to any inner face $vxw$ with $x\in I(C)$ then $B(H-vw)=B(H)$ and $I(H-vw)=I(H)$, and $H-vw$ is a is dom-preserving subgraph of $H$ that has fewer edges than $H$.
%
%     \item If there exists a vertex $v\in B(C)$ with $\deg^+_C(v)=0$ then $v$ is incident to an edge $vw$ that is on the outer face of $C$ and on the outer face of $H$. Since $\deg^+_C(v)=0$, $vw$ is not incident to any inner face $vwx$ with $x\in I(C)$ and we can proceed as in the previous case. \qedhere
